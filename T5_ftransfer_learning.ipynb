      "RIVERSIDE, Calif. As federal officials scour the backgrounds of the couple who went on a terrorist rampage here last week, they are looking carefully at Enrique Marquez, a childhood friend and relation by marriage of the husband, Syed Rizwan Farook. It was Mr. Marquez, 24, who bought the two assault rifles that Mr. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, used to carry out the attack, which killed 14 people and wounded 21 others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Marquez, who works at a Walmart store, bought the weapons legally in 2011 or 2012 and either gave or sold them to Mr. Farook, federal officials said. Investigators have spoken with Mr. Marquez and were keeping close tabs on him although they have not named him as a suspect, they believe he has knowledge about the Farook family and its recent activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November 2014, Mr. Marquez married Mariya Chernykh, whose sister, Tatiana, is married to Syed Raheel Farook, brother of Syed Rizwan Farook. Tatiana Farook is a hairstylist and makeup artist who also goes by the name Tatiana Gigliotti. She and her husband were witnesses at the wedding of Mr. Marquez and Ms. Chernykh, according to a marriage certificate released by the California Department of Public Health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another of Mr. Farook s siblings, Saira, is married to Farhan Khan. For some period of time the Khans attended the same mosque as Mr. Marquez, who is a convert to Islam, according to people who know them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Marquez could be crucial in helping the Federal Bureau of Investigation determine when the couple began their plot and understand more about their thinking. On Monday, F.B.I. officials said that both Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik had been radicalized for years and had gone to target practice ranges in the days before the attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Marquez started attending the Islamic Society of Corona Norco four and a half or five years ago, soon after he converted to Islam at a different mosque, according to Azmi Hasan, the facilities manager at the Islamic Society. At first, Mr. Marquez came about once a month, usually to Friday Prayer.\n",

      " He looked like a regular kid, Mr. Hasan said.\n",

      "\n",
      "As time went on, Mr. Marquez attended less often, perhaps every three or four months. Once, he went eight months between visits. Mr. Hasan asked where he had been, but Mr. Marquez offered little explanation.\n",

      "Mr. Hasan said he had not seen Mr. Marquez at all in about three years.\n",

      "On Saturday, investigators raided the modest stucco home here where Mr. Marquez lived with his family, opening the garage door with blowtorches and sending in bomb sniffing dogs. The next day, agents returned and seized more items.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Farook had since moved away, but for almost a decade, he lived next door to Mr. Marquez in this suburban neighborhood of palm and pine tree lined streets. Sometimes, Mr. Marquez would hop the short brick wall that separated their yards to hang out, a relative said. Or Mr. Marquez would pitch in as Mr. Farook worked on cars, a hobby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Marquez s name first appeared in connection with the attack on a list left by federal investigators after they raided Mr. Farook s home in Redlands, Calif., where the authorities said the couple had stashed weapons and built pipe bombs in the garage. They seized an empty long gun box in Mr. Marquez s name. The F.B.I. has declined to say if his transfer of the rifles to Mr. Farook violated California law, which requires even private sales or gifts of firearms to be done through a licensed dealer.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a time last week, officials could not find Mr. Marquez, but then found that he had checked himself into a mental health facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Marquez s stepfather, Gustavo Ramirez, said in a recent interview outside his family s home that he was stunned by the claim that his stepson had purchased firearms for Mr. Farook and his wife. I have no idea, he said. It is so strange to us. We don t have anything to do with guns. \n",
      "\n",
      "He said Mr. Marquez grew up with the Farook family and went to school with one of Mr. Farook s sisters. Mr. Marquez now splits his time between his family s home and his girlfriend s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigators said that about 28,000 had been deposited in an account in Mr. Farook s name at Web Bank, an online bank based in Utah, in the weeks before the attack. They said the deposit, reported by Fox News, had come from a loan arranged by Prosper, a San Francisco company. Such loans are typically processed almost entirely online and can be approved in days, while traditional banks can take weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokeswoman for Prosper declined to comment on whether Mr. Farook had received a loan, but said in a statement, All loans originated through the Prosper platform are subject to all identity verification and screening procedures required by law, including U.S. antiterrorism and anti money laundering laws. \n",

      "Also Tuesday, a closely watched index indicated U.S. home prices dropped 9 in the final quarter of 2007 from a year earlier. That s the steepest decline in the 20 year history of the SandP Case Shiller home price index.\n",

      "The central bank s ability to maneuver could be limited if the inflation rate continues rising. But in a Tuesday speech, Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn suggested the Fed is worried more about slow growth than rising prices.

He said a severe credit crunch and plunging housing market threaten economic growth.\n",

With the exception of a drop in consumer sentiment in 2003, the report is the most downbeat in 15 years. Things don t look much brighter down the line. Consumers assessment of economic conditions in the next six months is at a 17 year low, according to the survey.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fed is closely watching consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity. While the confidence figures don t necessarily predict a slowdown in spending, households are under stress from a slowing job market, sluggish wages, declining home equity and high food and energy prices.\n",

      "One last point for the day. A New Orleans blog notes that some of the money BP has given to the city has apparently been plowed into an ad campaign evoking the damage done to the city during the war of 1812, with the tag line This isn t the first time New Orleans has survived the British. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. DeGette expressed frustration that Mr. Hayward would not say if the long term health care costs of people affected by the spill would be paid from the 20 billion escrow fund. He said it is for the independent adjudicator to decide which claims will be paid from the fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. DeGette, a Colorado Democrat, asked Mr. Hayward to ask his technical expert who has been sitting silently behind him all day if he can help answer a specific question about how cement was used to try to seal the well. Mr. Hayward turned away for a few moments to speak with the expert and then returned to say that he the man is an expert on drilling, not sealing wells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Representative Steve Scalise returned to the question of how amateurs with bright ideas on how to stop the spill can get them to BP. He also seemed unaware that there is a system in place to gather and evaluate those ideas. According to Mr. Scalise, many of the ideas he has heard have tremendous merit. He told Mr. Hayward, if you ve got more ideas, try em all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps proving that members of Congress are so busy that they just cannot keep up with the news, or that there is no limit to how much faith some of them have in the idea that ordinary folk know better than experts how to do everything, Representative Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, just told Mr. Hayward a few minutes ago that he really wished the company would make it easier for people sitting at home watching the oil spill on their computer monitors and television sets to share their ideas about how to stop it. He suggested that it would be great if there was a telephone number to handle such suggestions. Americans are terribly we have a lot of ingenuity in America, he said.\n",

      "Who would the GOP put in charge of overseeing the energy industry and Big Oil if they won control of Congress? Yup, u guessed it JOE BARTON\n",

Congressman Barton s statements this morning were wrong. BP itself has acknowledged that responsibility for the economic damages lies with them and has offered an initial pledge of 20 billion dollars for that purpose. \n",
      "\n",
      "As Andrew Clark points out on The Guardian s Web site, BP has repeatedly stressed the crucial role of the failed blow out preventer in today s hearing. This piece of kit, made by the US firm Cameron, seems to be at the center of any effort by BP to get other firms to shoulder a portion of the blame for the Gulf disaster. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after that, when Mr. Barton asked Mr. Hayward to suggest what might be learned for the future, he replied \n",
      "\n",
      " I believe the most important one is to take the fail safe mechanism that is the blow out preventer and design it so that it is genuinely fail safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Stupak then pointed out to Mr. Hayward that just two weeks ago, in an op ed he wrote for the Wall Street Journal, he called the blow out preventer, fail safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "We in the industry have long had great confidence in the blow out preventer as the ultimate failsafe piece of safety equipment. Yet on this occasion it failed, with disastrous consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the April 20 explosions and fire, BP is carefully evaluating the subsea blow out preventers used in all our drilling operations world wide, including the testing and maintenance procedures of our drilling contractors using the devices. We will participate in industry wide efforts to improve the safety and reliability of subsea blow out preventers and deep water drilling practices.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Stupak and Mr. Hayward continue to speak past each other for several minutes, with Mr. Stupak insisting that the system cannot be fail safe if it can fail. Mr. Hayward, using the technical sense of the term, continues to insist that it is the fail safe mechanism, although it can fail.\n",

      "MSNBC s First Read blog has posted yet another apology from Representative Joe Barton retracting his first apology of the day, to BP \n",
      "\n",
      "I apologize for using the term shakedown with regard to yesterday s actions at the White House in my opening statement this morning, and I retract my apology to BP. As I told my colleagues yesterday and said again this morning, BP should bear the full financial responsibility for the accident on their lease in the Gulf of Mexico. BP should fully compensate those families and businesses that have been hurt by this accident. BP and the federal government need to stop the leak, clean up the damage, and take whatever steps necessary to prevent a similar accident in the future. I regret the impact that my statement this morning implied that BP should not pay for the consequences of their decisions and actions in this incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to a question from Representative Kathy Castor, who said that the government has been told over and over that off shore oil drilling is safe, Mr. Hayward said that the blow out preventer was designed to fail between one in a hundred thousand and one in a million times. Ms. Castor said that means that the blow out preventers are not fail safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Representative Charlie Melancon, a Democrat from Louisiana, asked Mr. Hayward why, of more than 600 ideas on how to stop the flow of oil sent to the committee by outsiders and forwarded on to the company, only three have gotten any response. Mr. Hayward said We are trying very hard to engage with everyone who has a good idea we have, quite frankly, been inundated with hundreds of thousands of ideas. Mr. Melancon said that he understands that some of them are, essentially, absurd.\n",

You ve talked about your commitment to safety and the environment but when push came to shove on the Deepwater Horizon, the company s concern seemed to be the bottom line.

Indeed, this is personal for us at BP. Many of our 23,000 U.S. employees live and work in the Gulf Coast region. For decades, the people of the Gulf Coast states have extended their hospitality to us and to the companies like Arco and Amoco that are now part of BP. We have always strived to be a good neighbor.

What is the appropriate regulatory framework for the industry? We don t yet have answers to all these important questions. But I hear the concerns, fears, frustrations and anger being voiced across the country. I understand it, and I know that these sentiments will continue until the leak is stopped, and until we prove through our actions that we will do the right thing. Our actions will mean more than words, and we know that, in the end, we will be judged by the quality of our response. Until this happens, no words will be satisfying.\n",

And while we can t undo these tragic events, I give you my word that we will do the right thing. We will not rest until the well is under control, and we will meet all our obligations to clean up the spill and address its environmental and economic impacts.\n",

      "From the moment I learned of the explosion and fire, I committed the global resources of BP to the response efforts. To be sure, neither I nor the company is perfect. But we are unwavering in our commitment to fulfill all our responsibilities. We are a strong company, and nothing is being spared. We are going to do everything in our power to address fully the economic and environmental consequences of this spill and to ensure that we use the lessons learned from this incident to make energy exploration and production safer and more reliable for everyone.\n",

      "We have been committed to responding to these tragic events and coordinating with the federal government from the beginning. On April 21, the Administration began holding meetings and regular calls with me and other members of BP s leadership to discuss BP s response effort, as well as federal oversight and support. Even before the Deepwater Horizon sank on the morning of April 22, a Unified Command structure was established, as provided by federal regulations. Currently led by the National Incident Commander, Admiral Thad Allen, the Unified Command provides a structure for BP s work with the Coast Guard, the Minerals Management Service and Transocean, among others.

And including BP, industry and government resources, more than 27,000 personnel are now engaged in the response in various activities such as booming, skimming, surveying, clean up operations, wildlife protection and rehabilitation and claims support. In addition, we are helping to train and organize the more than 19,000 citizen volunteers who have come forward to offer their services. The outpouring of support from government, industry, businesses and private citizens has truly been both humbling and inspiring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our efforts in response to this incident are focused on two critical goals \n",
      "\n",
      " Successfully stopping the flow of oil and Minimizing the environmental and economic impacts from the oil spill.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are without a doubt complex and challenging tasks. While we have had to overcome hurdles, we are doing everything we can to respond as quickly and effectively as we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the beginning, we have been committed to a transparent response. We know the public wants as much information as possible about this unprecedented event, and we continue to do our best to provide it so the public can understand the incident and its impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first priority is to stop the flow of oil and secure the well.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are currently drilling two relief wells, which we believe represents the ultimate solution to stopping the flow of oil and gas from the well. The first relief well is currently at a depth of 15,226 feet, and the second relief well is currently at 9,778 feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Separately, the goal has been to minimize or stop the flow of oil and gas before the relief wells are completed. From the beginning, we have implemented a multifaceted strategy, featuring a range of technological approaches. Our efforts to stop the well from the seabed included a number of interventions to the failed BOP, and the top kill procedure. We understand the public s frustration that these approaches did not stop the flow of oil. We, too, were disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although we were not able to stop the well at the seabed, our efforts to contain the oil and gas have been more successful. While our first attempt with a Containment Dome was not successful due to gas hydrate formation, we learned lessons that have underpinned subsequent successes. Specifically, we first deployed a Riser Insertion Tube Tool that overcame these gas hydrate problems and captured more than 2,000 barrels per day for ten days. On June 3, we replaced this with the Lower Marine Riser Package Cap, which had increased our collection to about 15,000 barrels per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday morning, we were in the early stages of increasing oil and gas collection through our next containment step, the Q4000 Direct Connect. It utilizes much of the subsea top kill equipment and takes oil directly from the failed BOP to the Q4000 on the surface. We expect to optimize collection over the next few days to levels well above what was previously accomplished.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to keep in mind that these techniques have never before been attempted 5,000 feet under water. On the seabed, we have made unprecedented use of ROVs for a variety of tasks, including working on the BOP, positioning riser cutting devices and slings, connecting hoses, positioning containment devices and providing extensive surveying and monitoring. We cannot guarantee the outcome of these operations, but we are working around the clock with the best experts from government and industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continue to do more to increase our operational flexibility and collection capability. This includes securing vessels with greater processing and storage capacity, adding shuttle tankers for transporting oil, procuring spares of critical equipment, installing permanent riser systems, and replacing the containment cap with a more secure system. We will not rest with our containment efforts until the well is permanently killed. I know it feels like this all takes a long time but we are compressing operations that normally take months into days.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to these containment operations, and with the approval of the Unified Command and in conjunction with the EPA, we continue injecting dispersant subsea using ROVs. Dispersant acts by separating the oil into small droplets that can break down more easily through natural processes before they reach the surface. Use of dispersant subsea reduces the amount of oil traveling to the surface, which, in turn, reduces the amount of spray dispersant required at the surface. In addition, dispersant use at the source requires approximately one quarter of the amount of dispersant that would be necessary for use on the surface. Sonar testing and aerial photographs show encouraging results.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been a lot of discussion about the use of dispersants. On June 4, a federal panel of experts studying this issue recommended continued use of dispersants after analyzing potential risks and benefits for the environment. The dispersant we are using Corexit is on the National Contingency Plan Product Schedule, which is maintained by the EPA. We will continue to work closely with the EPA to try to identify alternative dispersants and to monitor the situation closely. We will only use dispersants in ways approved by the Unified Command, supported by the EPA and other relevant agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "BP is a responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act. This means that federal law requires BP, as one of the working interest owners of Mississippi Canyon 252, to pay to clean up the spill and to compensate for the economic and environmental impacts of the spill. Let me be clear BP has accepted this responsibility and will fulfill this obligation. We have spent nearly 1.5 billion so far, and we will not stop until the job is done. It is important to understand that this responsible party designation is distinct from an assessment of legal liability for the actions that led to the spill. Investigations into the causes of the incident are ongoing, and issues of liability will be sorted out separately when the facts are clear and all the evidence is available. The focus now is on ensuring that cleanup, and compensation for those harmed by the spill, are carried out as quickly as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our cleanup efforts are focused on two fronts in the open water and at the shoreline.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the open water, more than 4,200 response vessels are in use, including skimmers, storage barges, tugs, and other vessels. The Hoss barge, the world s largest skimming vessel, has been onsite since April 25. In addition, there are 49 deepwater skimming vessels, which includes ten 210 foot MSRC Oil Responder Class Vessels, which each have the capacity to collect, separate, and store 4,000 barrels of oily water mix. To date, over 400,000 barrels of oily water mix have been recovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of our response efforts, over 2,000 Vessels of Opportunity , independent vessel owners throughout the Gulf Coast are using their boats in a variety of oil recovery activities, including towing and deploying booms, supporting skimming and burn operations, finding and recovering tar balls and transporting general supplies and personnel. Also on the open water, with the Coast Guard s approval, we are attacking the spill area with EPA approved biodegradable dispersants, which are being applied from both planes and boats.\n",
      "\n",
      " Actions to protect the shoreline\n",
      "\n",
      "Near the shoreline, we are implementing oil spill response contingency plans to protect sensitive areas. According to the Coast Guard, the result is the most massive shoreline protection effort ever mounted. To support rapid response, we have made available a total of 175 million to Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, as well as 70 million to assist these states in tourism promotion efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "To date, we have deployed over 2.5 million feet of containment boom and over 3.0 million feet of sorbent boom in an effort to contain the spill and protect the coastal shoreline. The Department of Defense is helping to airlift boom to wherever it is currently needed across the Gulf coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Highly mobile, shallow draft skimmers are also staged along the coast ready to attack the oil where it approaches the shoreline. Wildlife clean up stations have been mobilized, and pre impact baseline assessment and beach clean up has been completed in many locations, Shoreline cleanup assessment teams SCAT are being deployed to affected areas to assess the type and quantity of oiling, so the most effective cleaning strategies can be rapidly applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our largest single project commitment to date is to fund the 360 million cost of six berms in the Louisiana barrier islands project. On June 7, we announced that we will make an immediate payment of 60 million to the state of Louisiana to allow the state to begin work on the project immediately. BP will make five additional 60 million payments when the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana certifies that the project has satisfied 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 and then 100 completion milestones. The entire 360 million will be funded by the completion of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, BP is committing up to 500 million to an open research program studying the impact of the Deepwater Horizon incident, and the associated response, on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico. The program will investigate the impacts of the oil, dispersed oil, and dispersant on the ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico and coastal States.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also working hard to keep the public and government officials around the country informed of what is happening. We are regularly briefing federal, state, and local officials, and we are holding town hall sessions to keep affected communities informed.\n",
      "\n",
      "BP is also supporting volunteer efforts related to shoreline clean up. We have partnered with existing volunteer organizations in each of the states to ensure efficient registration and deployment of volunteers to the areas where they can help most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Untrained volunteers are not being used for any work involving contact or handling of oil, tar balls, or other hydrocarbon materials. This work is being carried out by trained personnel. In some cases, volunteers who receive more intensive training on the safe handling of hazardous materials and vessel operation for laying boom can become contract employees Qualified Community Responders .\n",
      "\n",
      "There are twenty five BP community outreach sites engaging, training, and preparing volunteers in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. A phone line has also been established for potential volunteers to register their interest in assisting the response effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize that beyond the environmental impacts there are also economic impacts on many of the people who rely on the Gulf for their livelihood. BP will pay all necessary cleanup costs and all legitimate claims for other losses and damages caused by the spill.\n",
      "\n",
      "The BP claims process is integral to our commitment to do the right thing. To date, BP has already paid out over 90 million on the more than 56,000 claims that have been submitted. While the initial focus has been on individuals, we are now moving funds on an expedited basis to business owners with nearly 16 million to be paid out this week to businesses alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure the process is as fair and transparent as possible, an independent mediator will be appointed to provide an independent judgment in cases in which BP and a claimant are in disagreement. The mediator will be fully independent of BP, and claimants who disagree with the mediator s judgment will retain all rights under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 either to seek reimbursement from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund or to file a claim in court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty two walk in claims offices are open in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi. Our call center is operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We also have in place an on line claims filing system. Nearly 700 people are assigned to handle the claims, including almost 600 experienced claims adjusters working in the impacted communities. Claim forms can be filled out in English, Spanish or Vietnamese, and Spanish and Vietnamese translators are available in many offices.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are striving to be efficient and fair and we look for guidance to the established laws, regulations and other information provided by the US Coast Guard, which oversees the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will continue adding people, offices and resources as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question we all want answered is What caused this tragic accident ?\n",
      "\n",
      "A full answer to this and other questions must await the outcome of multiple investigations now underway, including a joint investigation by the Departments of Homeland Security and Interior Marine Board and an internal investigation by BP itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our internal investigation was launched on April 21, 2010 and is being conducted by BP s Head of Group Safety and Operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The investigation team s work thus far suggests that this accident was brought about by the apparent failure of a number of processes, systems and equipment. While the team s work is not done, it appears that there were multiple control mechanisms procedures and equipment in place that should have prevented this accident or reduced the impact of the spill. The investigation is focused on the following seven mechanisms \n",
      "\n",
      "1. The cement that seals the reservoir from the well 2. The casing system,which seals the well bore 3. The pressure tests to confirm the well is sealed 4. The execution of procedures to detect and control hydrocarbons in the well, including the use of the blowout preventer BOP and the maintenance of that BOP 5. The BOP Emergency Disconnect System, which can be activated by pushing a button at multiple locations on the rig 6. The automatic closure of the BOP after its connection is lost with the rig and 7. Features in the BOP to allow ROVs to close the BOP and thereby seal the well at the seabed after a blowout.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand people want a simple answer about why this happened and who is to blame. The truth, however, is that this is a complex accident, caused by an unprecedented combination of failures. A number of companies are involved, including BP, and it is simply too early to understand the cause. There is still extensive work to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are events that occurred on April 20 that were not foreseen by me or BP, but which we need to address in the future as lessons learned from this terrible tragedy. With ongoing investigations into the incident and continuing efforts to secure the well, we are in the early stages of trying to learn from this incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, as I see it, there are already lessons to be learned, and I wanted to share two of them with you today. Lesson 1 Based on the events of April 20 and thereafter, we need to be better prepared for a subsea disaster. It is clear that our industry needs to significantly improve our ability to quickly address deep sea accidents of this type and magnitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The industry has made significant strides in preparedness measures before, and we will do so again. Following the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the industry recognized the need to enhance its capacity to address oil spills. The result was the MSRC, an independent, nonprofit company which maintains a significant inventory of vessels, equipment and trained personnel, complemented by a large contractor work force. The work of MSRC and other contractors has been central to the surface spill response efforts in the Gulf.\n",
      "\n",
      "But based on the events of April 20 and thereafter, it is clear that this is not enough. We now need to develop a similar capability for dealing with large undersea spills. We have no doubt that others in the industry will join us in efforts to develop this capability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lesson 2 Based on what happened on April 20, we now know we need better safety technology. We in the industry have long relied on the blowout preventer as the principal piece of safety equipment. Yet, on this occasion it apparently failed, with disastrous consequences. We must use this incident as a case study to avoid a similar failure in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the April 20 explosion and fire, BP has been carefully evaluating the subsea blow out preventers used in all our drilling operations worldwide, including the testing and maintenance procedures of the drilling contractors using the devices. We will participate in industry wide efforts to improve the safety and reliability of subsea blowout preventers and deep water drilling practices. And we will work closely with other interested parties as we do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "We understand the seriousness of the situation. We know the world is watching us. No one will forget the 11 men who lost their lives in the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon. We hear and understand the concerns, frustrations, and fears that have been and will continue to be voiced. I understand that only actions and results, and not mere words, ultimately can give you the confidence you seek. We will be, and deserve to be, judged by our response.\n",
      "\n",
      "I give my pledge as leader of BP that we will not rest until we stop this well, mitigate the environmental impact of the spill and address economic claims in a responsible manner. No resource available to this company will be spared. We and the entire industry will learn from this terrible event and emerge from it stronger, smarter and safer.\n",

      "\n",
      "The concerns stem from provisions in the 1973 War Powers Resolution. The resolution, passed in defiance of then President Nixon at the tail end of the Vietnam War, states that presidents must seek congressional approval to keep U.S. forces in hostilities for more than two months. Friday was the 60th day of U.S. involvement in the U.N. backed military intervention in Libya.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked about the requirements in the law, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney cited the president s ongoing consultation with Congress and claimed his actions have been and are consistent with the War Powers Resolution. He said the White House would continue to consult with Congress, adding that the administration would welcome an expression of support from lawmakers.\n",

      "\n",
      "Compliance with the War Powers Resolution has been a muddy area ever since its enactment. Presidents routinely claim it is unconstitutional, but the law has not been struck down in court. Congress and the White House historically have avoided major standoffs over the law because either military intervention has ended before the 60 day deadline or Congress approved the intervention for instance, with the two Iraq wars. President Clinton squared off in a War Powers Resolution fight against Congress over bombing in Kosovo in 1999, but the president won that fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sen. John McCain, R Ariz., who had been working on legislative language in support of the military action in Libya, recently told Fox News that he does not think the law is constitutional either. He said there doesn t seem to be any great movement towards acting. \n",

Another potential benefit of going green is that it makes environmentally minded employees happy, increasing their loyalty to the firm.\\n\\nA Berlin brothel has hit on another way to use environmental arguments to its benefit price discrimination. Mary MacPherson Lane writes in an AP article \\n\\nThe bordellos in the capital of Germany, where prostitution is legal, have seen business suffer with the global financial crisis. Patrons have become more frugal and there are fewer potential customers coming to the city for business trips and conferences.\\n\\nBut Maison d Envie has seen its business begin to return since it began offering the euro 5 7.50 discount in July, Goetz said.\\n\\nTo qualify, customers must show the receptionist either a bicycle padlock key or proof they used public transit to get to the neighborhood. That knocks the price for 45 minutes in a room, for example, to euro 65 from euro 70.\\n\\nAlthough the brothel says the reason for the price discount is that it wants to be environmentally conscious, it sure looks to me like the brothel is dressing up some good old fashioned price discrimination arguments in a green disguise.\\n\\nCustomers who come by bus or bicycle are likely to have lower incomes and be more price sensitive than those who arrive by car. If that is the case, the brothel would like to charge such customers lower prices than the richer ones. The difficulty is that, without a justifiable rationale, the rich customers would be angry if the brothel tried to charge them more and indeed, how in general, would the brothel know who is rich? . The environmental argument gives the brothel cover for doing what it always wanted to do anyway.'"

       "'RIVERSIDE, Calif. As federal officials scour the backgrounds of the couple who went on a terrorist rampage here last week, they are looking carefully at Enrique Marquez, a childhood friend and relation by marriage of the husband, Syed Rizwan Farook. It was Mr. Marquez, 24, who bought the two assault rifles that Mr. Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, used to carry out the attack, which killed 14 people and wounded 21 others.\\n\\nMr. Marquez, who works at a Walmart store, bought the weapons legally in 2011 or 2012 and either gave or sold them to Mr. Farook, federal officials said. Investigators have spoken with Mr. Marquez and were keeping close tabs on him although they have not named him as a suspect, they believe he has knowledge about the Farook family and its recent activities.\\n\\nIn November 2014, Mr. Marquez married Mariya Chernykh, whose sister, Tatiana, is married to Syed Raheel Farook, brother of Syed Rizwan Farook. Tatiana Farook is a hairstylist and makeup artist who also goes by the name Tatiana Gigliotti. She and her husband were witnesses at the wedding of Mr. Marquez and Ms. Chernykh, according to a marriage certificate released by the California Department of Public Health.\\n\\nAnother of Mr. Farook s siblings, Saira, is married to Farhan Khan. For some period of time the Khans attended the same mosque as Mr. Marquez, who is a convert to Islam, according to people who know them.\\n\\nMr. Marquez could be crucial in helping the Federal Bureau of Investigation determine when the couple began their plot and understand more about their thinking. On Monday, F.B.I. officials said that both Mr. Farook and Ms. Malik had been radicalized for years and had gone to target practice ranges in the days before the attack.\\n\\nMr. Marquez started attending the Islamic Society of Corona Norco four and a half or five years ago, soon after he converted to Islam at a different mosque, according to Azmi Hasan, the facilities manager at the Islamic Society. At first, Mr. Marquez came about once a month, usually to Friday Prayer.\\n\\n He looked like a regular kid, Mr. Hasan said.\\n\\nPart of Mr. Hasan s job was to know everyone at the mosque and make them feel welcome. He said he sometimes had quick conversations with Mr. Marquez, just regular greetings How are you? How s your family? \\n\\nAs time went on, Mr. Marquez attended less often, perhaps every three or four months. Once, he went eight months between visits. Mr. Hasan asked where he had been, but Mr. Marquez offered little explanation.\\n\\nMr. Hasan said he had not seen Mr. Marquez at all in about three years.\\n\\nOn Saturday, investigators raided the modest stucco home here where Mr. Marquez lived with his family, opening the garage door with blowtorches and sending in bomb sniffing dogs. The next day, agents returned and seized more items.\\n\\nMr. Farook had since moved away, but for almost a decade, he lived next door to Mr. Marquez in this suburban neighborhood of palm and pine tree lined streets. Sometimes, Mr. Marquez would hop the short brick wall that separated their yards to hang out, a relative said. Or Mr. Marquez would pitch in as Mr. Farook worked on cars, a hobby.\\n\\nMr. Marquez s name first appeared in connection with the attack on a list left by federal investigators after they raided Mr. Farook s home in Redlands, Calif., where the authorities said the couple had stashed weapons and built pipe bombs in the garage. They seized an empty long gun box in Mr. Marquez s name. The F.B.I. has declined to say if his transfer of the rifles to Mr. Farook violated California law, which requires even private sales or gifts of firearms to be done through a licensed dealer.\\n\\nFor a time last week, officials could not find Mr. Marquez, but then found that he had checked himself into a mental health facility.\\n\\nMr. Marquez s stepfather, Gustavo Ramirez, said in a recent interview outside his family s home that he was stunned by the claim that his stepson had purchased firearms for Mr. Farook and his wife. I have no idea, he said. It is so strange to us. We don t have anything to do with guns. \\n\\nHe said Mr. Marquez grew up with the Farook family and went to school with one of Mr. Farook s sisters. Mr. Marquez now splits his time between his family s home and his girlfriend s.\\n\\nInvestigators said that about 28,000 had been deposited in an account in Mr. Farook s name at Web Bank, an online bank based in Utah, in the weeks before the attack. They said the deposit, reported by Fox News, had come from a loan arranged by Prosper, a San Francisco company. Such loans are typically processed almost entirely online and can be approved in days, while traditional banks can take weeks.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Prosper declined to comment on whether Mr. Farook had received a loan, but said in a statement, All loans originated through the Prosper platform are subject to all identity verification and screening procedures required by law, including U.S. antiterrorism and anti money laundering laws. \\n\\nReporting was contributed by Julie Turkewitz from Riverside, Michael Corkery and Michael S. Schmidt from New York, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.\\n\\nA version of this article appears in print on December 9, 2015, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline Buyer of Guns Used in Attack Is Studied.

       "'By Sue Kirchhoff, USA TODAY\\n\\nWASHINGTON Consumer confidence plunged to the lowest since the onset of the Iraq war in 2003, while wholesale inflation surged to the highest yearly rate in a quarter century, according to Tuesday reports offering fresh evidence the economy is teetering near recession.\\n\\nAlso Tuesday, a closely watched index indicated U.S. home prices dropped 9 in the final quarter of 2007 from a year earlier. That s the steepest decline in the 20 year history of the SandP Case Shiller home price index.\\n\\nThe reports complicate the work of the Federal Reserve, which has been cutting interest rates since September to ease a credit crunch in financial markets and bolster business and consumer spending.\\n\\nThe central bank s ability to maneuver could be limited if the inflation rate continues rising. But in a Tuesday speech, Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn suggested the Fed is worried more about slow growth than rising prices. I do not expect the recent elevated inflation rates to persist, Kohn said in a speech at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. He said a severe credit crunch and plunging housing market threaten economic growth.\\n\\nKohn also repeated Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke s promise that the Fed will do what is needed, which analysts took as a sign more rate cuts are in store.\\n\\nDemocrats in Congress are calling for more vigorous action to address the slumping housing market. President Bush, however, said Tuesday the economy should avoid recession. We re not in a recession I don t think we will go in a recession. We re in a slowdown, and there s a difference, Bush told American Urban Radio Networks.\\n\\nThe New York based Conference Board said its consumer confidence index plunged to a reading of 75 in February from 87.3 in January. With the exception of a drop in consumer sentiment in 2003, the report is the most downbeat in 15 years. Things don t look much brighter down the line. Consumers assessment of economic conditions in the next six months is at a 17 year low, according to the survey.\\n\\nThe Fed is closely watching consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity. While the confidence figures don t necessarily predict a slowdown in spending, households are under stress from a slowing job market, sluggish wages, declining home equity and high food and energy prices.\\n\\n The expectations number is what counts, says Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics. The drop is absolutely disastrous. \\n\\nSeparately, the U.S. Labor Department said the wholesale inflation rate jumped 1 in January, about double economists predictions, and is up 7.4 , not seasonally adjusted, in the past 12 months.\\n\\nPrices for finished energy goods gasoline and home heating oil, for example rose 1.5 in January, while food prices increased 1.7 , the biggest bump in four years. Over 12 months ended in January, prices for finished energy goods climbed 22.6 .\\n\\nConversation guidelines USA TODAY welcomes your thoughts, stories and information related to this article.

       "'First things first just in case the headline isn t enough of a giveaway, this article may contain spoilers for Zack Snyder s forthcoming Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice, which stars Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill as the warring superheroes. If you don t like spoilers, we suggest you click away now, and look at this picture of Harrison Ford instead.\\n\\nWe re saying may contain spoilers , because it s not yet 100 clear whether the source of the new details is accurate. A Reddit user named ViolatingNDA, who is claiming to have seen an early screening of the film, has posted some plot and character information online, alongside a general review of the film.\\n\\nWhen challenged by commenters, the user provided a screen shot of a Warner Bros screening invitation as proof that he she actually saw the movie not the most compelling evidence in the world . It s also worth noting that there s been no corroboration of the rumours from other Hollywood based sources, and no confirmation that a screening took place at all.\\n\\nThat said, some of the post s claims about the film do sound as if they could be genuine. Below, we ve listed the most interesting.\\n\\n1. Scoot McNairy is definitely playing Jimmy Olsen\\n\\nThis was previously rumoured to be the case. Despite losing his legs in the destruction at the end of Snyder s previous Superman film, Man of Steel, Olsen is apparently still a big fan of Superman in the new movie.\\n\\n2. Jenna Malone is playing Commissioner Gordon s daughter\\n\\nEralier stories suggested that the Hunger Games actress had been cast as Carrie Kelly, a young woman who becomes Batman s sidekick Robin. But the new leak states she s actually playing a character named Barba Gordon, daughter of the late Commissioner Gordon.\\n\\n3. Dan Amboyer is playing the Green Lantern\\n\\nAccording to the Reddit post, actor Dan Amboyer currently credited as a simple drone pilot will be playing the Green Lantern in the film. A pilot named Hal Jordan, he is sent in to compete against an army of drones, assembled by Lex Luthor to protect the Earth from supernatural threats.\\n\\n LexCorp is basically developing a worldwide drone system to protect against alien invasion, writes ViolatingNDA. There is fierce opposition to it, especially from General Swanwick. He believes that humans should always be in control of powerful weapons such as the drones. This leads to a pretty cool scene of Swanwick sending his best pilot to compete against a drone, Hal Jordan! \\n\\nLater on in the thread, asked if Jordan is already the Green Lantern, ViolatingNDA confirms this is the case the character apparently reveals himself at the end during the drone fight .\\n\\n4. It will end with the formation of the full Justice League\\n\\nAccording to the Reddit post, while the first two acts of the film are focused on the Batman Superman conflict, the final part of the film is about the Dawn of Justice and focuses on the formation of a full Justice League, as Aquaman Jason Momoa , Cyborg Ray Fisher , The Flash Ezra Miller and Green Lantern team up with Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman Gal Gadot to take on Jesse Eisenberg s Lex Luthor.\\n\\nAs we mentioned before, the Reddit post is written like a review and, as reviews go, it s an extremely positive one.\\n\\nBen Affleck gives a standout performance , Eisenberg s Luthor is satisfyingly complex , everyone else is great and Batman vs Superman is apparently the greatest comic book movie since The Dark Knight .'"

The Curry County sheriff s department says two were able to get out of the water on their own, and two were rescued by law enforcement and fire officials.\\n\\nA man was also found dead aboard a commercial vessel in Brookings, but sheriff s officials said it appeared to be from natural causes.\\n\\nThe large waves shook loose boats in that weren t moved in time and tore apart wooden docks in at least two California harbors.\\n\\n This is just devastating. I never thought I d see this again, said Ted Scott, a retired mill worker who lived in Crescent City when a 1964 tsunami killed 17 people on the West Coast, including 11 in his town. I watched the docks bust apart. It buckled like a graham cracker. \\n\\nThe waves didn t make it over a 20 foot break wall protecting the rest of the city, and no home damage was immediately reported.\\n\\nDamage estimates in Crescent City were in the millions, and more boats and docks were hit in Santa Cruz on California s central coast. Surges are expected throughout the afternoon.\\n\\nPresident Obama said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is ready to come to the aid of any U.S. states or territories who need help.\\n\\nEarlier, the tsunami hit Hawaii before dawn, rushing up on roadways and into hotel lobbies on the Big Island and low lying areas in Maui were flooded as 7 foot waves crashed ashore.\\n\\nScientists warned that the first tsunami waves are not always the strongest, and officials said people in Hawaii and along the West Coast should remain vigilant. Tsunami warnings continued in California and Oregon, but were downgraded to an advisory in Hawaii, and Gov. Neil Abercrombie said the islands were fortunate almost beyond words. \\n\\n All of us had that feeling that Hawaii was just the most blessed place on the face of the Earth today, he said.\\n\\nThe tsunami, spawned by an 8.9 magnitude earthquake in Japan, killed hundreds as it slammed the eastern coast of Japan, sweeping away boats, cars, homes and people as widespread fires burned out of control. It raced across the Pacific at 500 mph as fast as a jetliner before hitting Hawaii and the West Coast. Sirens sounded for hours on the islands and the West Coast before dawn and roadways and beaches were mostly empty as the tsunami struck.\\n\\nIt is the second time in a little over a year that Hawaii and the U.S. West coast faced the threat of a massive tsunami. A magnitude 8.8 earthquake in Chile spawned warnings on Feb. 27, 2010, but the waves were much smaller than predicted and did little damage.\\n\\nScientists then acknowledged they overstated the threat but defended their actions, saying they took the proper steps and learned the lessons of the 2004 Indonesian tsunami that killed thousands of people who didn t get enough warning.\\n\\nThis time around, the warning went out within 10 minutes of the earthquake in Japan, said Gerard Fryer, a geophysicist for the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu.\\n\\n We called this right. This evacuation was necessary, Fryer said. There s absolutely no question, this was the right thing to do, he said.\\n\\nThe warnings issued by the tsunami center covered an area stretching the entire western coast of the United States and Canada from the Mexican border to Chignik Bay in Alaska.\\n\\nMany islands in the Pacific evacuated, but officials later told residents to go home because the waves weren t as bad as expected.\\n\\nIn Guam, the waves broke two U.S. Navy submarines from their moorings, but tug boats corralled the subs and brought them back to their pier. No damage was reported to Navy ships in Hawaii.\\n\\nIn the Canadian pacific coast province of British Columbia, authorities evacuated marinas, beaches and other areas.\\n\\nOfficials in two coastal Washington counties used an automated phone alert system, phoning residents on the coast and in low lying areas and asking them to move to higher ground.\\n\\n We certainly don t want to cry wolf, said Sheriff Scott Johnson of Washington s Pacific County. We just have to hope we re doing the right thing based on our information. We don t want to be wrong and have people hurt or killed.\\n\\nIn Oregon, hotels were evacuated and shops stayed shuttered in the northwest tourist town of Seaside, where arcades, salt water taffy shops and seafood restaurants line a beachfront boardwalk.\\n\\nLarge waves didn t materialize, and by noon coastal residents were expected to be able to return home.\\n\\n We weren t really worried about it, said Erik Bergman, whose roommate woke him early Friday.\\n\\nLatin American governments ordered islanders and coastal residents to head for higher ground. Coastal officials from Mexico to Chile were hauling boats from the sea, closing ports and schools and preparing to evacuate thousands of people ahead of the tsunami s expected arrival at 5 p.m. EST.\\n\\nHeavy swells rolled through ports and marinas of Mexico s Baja California resort of Cab San Lucas, and the major Pacific cargo port of Manzanillo was closed. Several cargo ships and a cruise ship decided to wait out a possible tsunami at sea rather than risk possible damage in a harbor.\\n\\nThe Honolulu International Airport remained open but seven or eight jets bound for Hawaii turned around, including some originating from Japan, the state Department of Transportation said. All harbors were closed and vessels were ordered to leave the harbor.\\n\\nAbout 70 percent of Hawaii s 1.4 million population resides in Honolulu, and as many as 100,000 tourists are in the city on any given day.\\n\\nA small 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck the Big Island just before 5 a.m. EST, but there were no reports of damages and the quake likely wasn t related to the much larger one in Japan, the USGS said.\\n\\nThe worst big wave to strike the U.S. was a 1946 tsunami caused by a magnitude of 8.1 earthquake near Unimak Islands, Alaska, that killed 165 people, mostly in Hawaii. In 1960, a magnitude 9.5 earthquake in southern Chile caused a tsunami that killed at least 1,716 people, including 61 people in Hilo. It also destroyed most of that city s downtown. On the U.S. mainland, a 1964 tsunami from a 9.2 magnitude earthquake in Prince William Sound, Alaska, struck Washington State, Oregon and California. It killed 128 people, including 11 in Crescent City, Calif.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report'"

       "'Art deco buildings in Miami Beach. Press Association \\n\\nCuban food, Latin American culture, babe filled beaches, and models, lots and lots of models Miami is a great melting pot of all types who find themselves on the suntanned shores of the Gold Coast in search of a good time.\\n\\nIt is the antidote to Mickey Mouse and the gated communities and pink stucco that south Florida replicates in robotic fashion. The city suffered from the recession and foreclosure cyclone that shook Florida, but that means it is a better bargain than it has been in years. It is also definitely a year round destination, so the longer you spend there, the better.\\n\\nWhat is it known for? The rhythm is gonna get you here. Just a wander up Lincoln Road on South Beach and a quick cortadito espresso from David s Caf on Collins Avenue is all you need to get in the mood. Miami is a party town for all sorts of visitors, and not that just the kind that arrive in a speed boat, Miami Vice style. South Beach is usually what comes to mind, with Art Deco buildings turned into boutique hotel paradise and the gorgeous bodies on the beach by day, stalking hotel lobbies like towering herds of giraffes in their stilettos at night. But Miami is also Florida s cultural centre the art world descends every December for Art Basel Miami Beach and the New World Symphony s new home designed by Frank Gehry, and its SoundScape Park, where passersbys can watch wallcasts of concerts in the hall, has garnered rave reviews from architects, music critics and everyone in between.\\n\\nMiami has had a recent uptick in its fashion cred with boutiques like The Webster opened by a founder of the concept store Colette in Paris , the raft of pop up stores, and the mid century furniture stores in the Design District. There is a well established Cuban population that has been joined by many Central American and South American groups, making it one of the best places for vaca frita, grilled corn and everything in between. Miami is also near one of the world s greatest wetlands, the Everglades. Head west on the Tamiami Trail and soon you will be in gator country, where fan boats push tourists across the water and those bumps on a log have lots of teeth.\\n\\nWhere do you want to live? Not surprisingly, many buyers and renters want to be near the beach, particularly South Beach for its great nightlife, restaurants and 24 hour action. Development has stretched northward to North Miami Beach, Sunny Isles and even Aventura, and prices are good. Miami is on sale, said Jack H. Levine, chairman of the Miami Association of Realtors. We are on pace for a record year in transactions, better than the peak year of 2005. But in terms of price point, we are at 50 percent lower than 2005. Across the Intracoastal near downtown Miami, the boom time condos and high rises in the Brickell area offer lower prices in a good location near the business district and great views of Biscayne Bay. Downtown Miami has gotten a lot more residential, giving it the 24 hour life it previously lacked. The Design District and Wynwood have been gentrifying and there are plans on the drawing board for condo development that are slowing coming back online after the housing market bottom fell out in 2008.\\n\\nHouse hunters should like Spanish style architecture with white or yellow stucco and red tiles. Coconut Grove is south of downtown, with wide, shaded streets and a laidback vibe that make it a permanently popular location with buyers. Nearby Coral Gables is a similar story.\\n\\nSide trips The Everglades are a great day trip, as is a drive down to the most northern islands of the Florida Keys or up to the Japanese Gardens of the Morikami Museum in Delray Beach. For a weekend, the rest of the Keys are a draw Key Largo, Islamorada, and of course, Key West, the delightfully unique and charming pinky toe of America. With multiple daily flights from Miami International Airport, the Caribbean islands make popular getaways, as does much of South America.\\n\\nMiami and nearby Fort Lauderdale are the great cruise ports, leaving for points south, and Orlando is a few hours north. There are great beaches up and down the west coast, on the Gulf of Mexico, where pods of dolphins ride along playfully with jet skiers.'"

       "'Edward Daly, who as the Roman Catholic bishop of Northern Ireland s second largest city argued relentlessly for peace during the three decades of sectarian violence known as the Troubles, died on Monday in Londonderry. He was 82.\\n\\nHis death, at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, was announced by Bishop Donal McKeown of Derry, the diocese that Bishop Daly led from 1974 to 1993, when he stepped down after having a stroke. The city, officially Londonderry, is commonly known by its shorter name. He was hospitalized after a fall several weeks ago.\\n\\n Bishop Daly served, without any concern for himself, throughout the traumatic years of the Troubles, finding his ministry shaped by the experience of witnessing violence and its effects, Bishop McKeown said in a statement.\\n\\nOn Jan. 30, 1972, as a 38 year old curate at St. Eugene s Cathedral, Father Daly escorted unarmed protesters on a march toward the city center when British soldiers opened fire, resulting in the deaths of 14 people. The massacre became known as Bloody Sunday.\\n\\nImages of Father Daly waving a bloodied white handkerchief as protesters tried to carry a wounded man, Jackie Duddy, to safety circulated around the world.\\n\\n I went in front with this handkerchief in my hand, and they carried Jackie behind me, he later told the BBC. All hell was let loose. We were very nervous and frightened, and when we laid him down on the pavement, he had died. \\n\\nHe added It was utterly disgraceful. There was nothing fired at them I can say that with absolute certainty because I was there. \\n\\nFather Daly later told The New York Times that the massacre fueled the growth of the Irish Republican Army, the paramilitary group that battled British security forces and the unionist segments of Northern Ireland s population throughout the Troubles.\\n\\n Many young people I have talked to in prison have told me they would have never joined the I.R.A. had it not been for what they witnessed on Bloody Sunday, he said.\\n\\nIn 2010, after a 12 year investigation that cost about 200 million pounds, or 265 million at current exchange rates, a serious and widespread loss of discipline among the soldiers was blamed for the massacre.\\n\\nBritain s prime minister at the time, David Cameron, apologized, calling the massacre unjustified and unjustifiable. The next year, the government agreed to compensate the victims families.\\n\\nEdward Daly was born on Dec. 5, 1933, in the village of Belleek, County Fermanagh, near the border with Ireland. He attended St. Columb s College, a boys grammar school in Londonderry, before the diocese sent him to the Pontifical Irish College in Rome to prepare for the priesthood.\\n\\nHe was ordained as a priest in 1957 and appointed a curate in Castlederg, County Tyrone in 1962, he was named a curate at St. Eugene s, the Roman Catholic cathedral in Londonderry, and he was ordained a bishop in 1974.\\n\\nAs bishop, he repeatedly denounced waves of violence. In 1976, he deplored a firebombing that destroyed much of Londonderry s shopping district, and in 1987, he stopped church funerals for I.R.A. men after one service was turned into a paramilitary display by republican gunmen.\\n\\nOn Oct. 24, 1990, the I.R.A., threatening to kill his family if he did not obey, forced Patrick Gillespie, 42, a Catholic kitchen worker at a British Army base, to drive a van containing explosives into a military checkpoint outside Londonderry.\\n\\nThe attack, one of three proxy bombs that day, killed Mr. Gillespie and five soldiers. At a Mass attended by Catholics and Protestants, Bishop Daly said the killers had crossed a new threshold of evil. \\n\\n They may say they are followers of Christ, he said. Some of them may even still engage in the hypocrisy of coming to church, but their lives and their works proclaim clearly that they follow Satan. \\n\\nBishop Daly was equally unsparing in his criticism of the British authorities. After prosecutors moved to quash the murder convictions of six Catholics who said they had been coerced into confessing to the 1974 bombings of two bars in Birmingham, England, he said in 1991, The justice system in Britain has problems, and it must face up to those problems. \\n\\nThe same year, he expressed alarm about the covert recruitment of I.R.A. members by the British security services some were found out and killed.\\n\\nThe Troubles largely ended in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement, which provided for self government in Northern Ireland with power sharing among its political factions.\\n\\nThe agreement also set out the principle that Northern Ireland would remain part of the United Kingdom until a majority of people in both Northern Ireland and Ireland wished otherwise.\\n\\nBishop Daly, who is survived by two sisters, spent his retirement as a chaplain to the Foyle Hospice in Londonderry and as archivist for the diocese.\\n\\nHe wrote two memoirs, Mister, Are You a Priest? 2000 and A Troubled See Memoirs of a Derry Bishop 2011 .\\n\\nIn the 2011 book, he questioned the Vatican s policy on priestly celibacy. I think priests should have the freedom to marry if they wish, he told the BBC, expressing worries about a shortage of priests.\\n\\nOn Monday, religious and secular leaders, Catholic and Protestant alike, mourned Bishop Daly s death.\\n\\nBishop Kenneth Good of Derry of the Church of Ireland, which is part of the Anglican Communion praised him for unwavering Christian leadership and guidance when it was desperately needed in this city and community, during the darkest days of the Troubles. \\n\\nFollow Sewell Chan on Twitter \\n\\nA version of this article appears in print on August 9, 2016, on page B16 of the New York edition with the headline Edward Daly, 82, Bishop During Troubles .
