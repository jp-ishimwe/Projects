            "\n",
            "Candlestick Park will always be for me, first and foremost, not about Joe Montana or Willie Mays but about my dad.\n",
            "\n",
            "When a team moves to swanky new digs and the building left behind becomes an empty shell, and eventually a pile of rubble, where do all our memories go? The Stick is packed with the ghosts of family legends, traces of generations' worth of outings, spirits of memorable moments of bonding.\n",
            "\n",
            "My dad's spirit is there. My 100 percent Irish father loved good stories, a big laugh and sports drama. And Candlestick Park provided plenty of all three.\n",
            "\n",
            "My father was thrilled when the Giants moved west, standing on Montgomery Street to greet them as ticker tape showered down upon him and my older brother, who was perched on his shoulders. Dad was excited when Candlestick Park opened. When then-Vice President Richard Nixon dubbed it \"one of the most beautiful baseball parks of all time,\" it was probably the only time my father agreed with the man.\n",
            "\n",
            "My father made it to the first World Series at Candlestick Park in 1962, waiting through four days of rain delays that puddled water on the field. That was nothing compared to the 27 years he'd have to wait until he saw his next World Series there, and by that time Candlestick was considered decrepit and outdated. But our family loyalty to the place was strengthened even then because my dad and brother, as well as everyone else, emerged unscathed from the 1989 earthquake.\n",
            "\n",
            "Candlestick became, as with so many families, a part of Killion lore. A piece of our tribal understanding.\n",
            "\n",
            "There was the day - a scorching hot afternoon in Mill Valley - when my parents went to a ballgame together. My mother wasn't a huge fan, so it was a notable occasion. Though my mother was a Bay Area native and my father had lived here long enough to understand the winds and weather patterns, they figured it was a perfect day for a ballgame. That game became famous: Willie McCovey's towering flyball dropped for a triple because Dodgers outfielder Duke Snider couldn't see it in the fog. Umpire Frank Dascoli waved the players off the field and delayed the game for 24 minutes. My parents shivered before escaping.\n",
            "\n",
            "Umpires soon learned there was no strategy that could circumvent the fog. That wasn't the only opinion that became cemented that day.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Your mother never wanted to go back,\" my dad told me.\n",
            "\n",
            "But my dad did. He wasn't a regular. He was content to experience most of his baseball games through the brown transistor radio that resided in his breast pocket throughout baseball season. But he made periodic pilgrimages to both the Giants and the 49ers. He was a loyal San Franciscan: He couldn't believe we were lucky enough to have the world's best baseball player and the best quarterback of all time playing in that windy old ballpark. The dramatic contrast between Candlestick and the athletes that played inside was just one part of the stadium's mystique.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was with my father that I first experienced the green expanses (which, sadly, I believe was AstroTurf in my earliest memories), towering escalators and chain link outfield fence of Candlestick. Thanks to him, I have faded but real memories of seeing Mays play.\n",
            "\n",
            "As I grew older, I created my own Stick experience. Sitting with my high school friends in the upper deck, swaddled in puffy down jackets with pockets big enough to hold a flask. Watching the Friday night fights in the stands when the Dodgers were in town. Walking into a 49ers game without tickets, because no one really checked back then when the team was so bad. Sneaking down into the \"box seats\" - which were regular seats barricaded by metal railings. Very fancy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Eventually, Candlestick stopped being a location for fun and became a place where I worked. The first time I covered a game at Candlestick, the creaky press elevator and drafty multi-tiered box were mysterious and intriguing, not annoying. The first thing I did when I got settled was to call my father.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Guess where I am, Dad. In the press box at Candlestick.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "My dad responded as if I had said the White House.\n",
            "\n",
            "Later, we took my parents and their grandkids to games. My father liked sitting on the top deck, looking at the expanse below him. He kept his transistor in his pocket, ate his peanuts and was perfectly content. When the Giants said they were going to move to Florida, I took my father and my young son to say a wistful goodbye, and ensure there was one more moment of family bonding.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the Giants stayed. And in April 2000, I took my dad on a tour of brand new Pacific Bell Park, days before the season opened. My father was frail and in a wheelchair, but he was overwhelmed by the beauty of the new ballpark. We promised to get to a game in that inaugural year. But a few weeks later Dad fell and broke his leg and his health spiraled downward. That October, not long after the Giants had been eliminated in the playoffs, my father died.\n",
            "\n",
            "He never made it to a game at the new ballpark. Candlestick was his park, always and forever.\n",
            "\n",
            "Soon, the concrete will be crumbled by a wrecking ball. But it can't destroy the memories.\n",
            "\n",

NStar, for example, has installed “self-healing” switch technology that locates power interruptions and automatically reroutes power around the problem to limit the extent of the outage. “A crew can then respond to fix the outage, but the total number of customers affected is significantly decreased,” said Caroline Pretyman a spokeswoman for Northeast Utilities, NStar’s parent company.\n",

Bed and breakfasts are seeing more guests than ever with an average room price of $160 per night — $50 more than the average nightly cost of a hotel room, according to a 2012 survey from the US-based Professional Association of Innkeepers International. Many visitors want to explore locales not served by a large hotel chain, said Jay Karen, association president. “Travellers want to go off the beaten path a bit,” he said.\n",

But be aware: the lifestyle takes plenty of effort, said Stefano Zocchi, who in 2006 opened La Palazzetta del Vescovo, a nine-bedroom guesthouse in Umbria, Italy, with his wife, Paola. The couple bought the place in 2000, but took their time with renovations and kept working their former jobs for several years before opening the guesthouse.\n",

            "Being busy makes the bed and breakfast profitable, but it can be tiring. Owners tend to take time to rest in long holidays. Friend and Barber, for instance, use quiet time over the winter to reinvest in the property and take a month-long vacation.\n",
            "\n",
            "How to choose and pay for a property\n",
            "\n",
            "Depending on size, location and the extent of renovations or retrofitting needed, an operational bed and breakfast could cost as little as $200,000 in rural or lesser-travelled locales and upwards of $600,000 or more in parts of Europe or in historic towns.\n",
            "\n",
            "A common strategy is to convert a residential home into a guesthouse that can accommodate visitors. Such a home might cost less to buy, but retrofitting and renovations can more than double the purchase price.\n",
            "\n",
            "The first question to ask: Will buying be a lifestyle change (that is, you plan to operate the inn yourself) or purely an investment (you’ll pay others to do a chunk of the work and reap profits)?\n",
            "\n",
            "The answer will help you determine the size of property to purchase, said Karen. Real estate agents specialising in holiday properties can help would-be owners find a property that’s viable for conversion or already operating as a bed and breakfast.\n",
            "\n",
            "When converting a residential property, most banks only provide financing based on your current income and won’t consider the potential income from the bed and breakfast, said Rick Wolf, a real estate agent and co-founder at the B&B Team, consulting firm in Maine in the US. Existing bed and breakfasts are typically sold as commercial properties and that allows owners to get a commercial mortgage in many countries.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the payoff, in the US, an average bed and breakfast has 9 rooms and between $200,000 and $500,000 in annual revenues. More than 30% of that is profit post-expenses (such as food, payroll, utilities and maintenance of the guesthouse), according to Professional Association of Innkeepers International survey.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bed and breakfast businesses can be a solid long-term investment — or a money loser, depending on where you buy. Wendy Snodgrass purchased the Bellavista Bed & Breakfast after a major hurricane, which brought prices down on St. Thomas, a part of the US Virgin Islands. Snodgrass said the purchase price was about 30% of current market rates, which start at around $600,000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Snodgrass, 47, and her partner, Doug Kriebel, run the inn without full-time employees. “We live pretty simply on the side and put the money back into the house,” she said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kate Warburton, 32, who owns a guesthouse on Roatan, an island off the coast of Honduras, said a “constant demand for beachfront rooms” has made her choice of locale a smart one. She is adding two more rooms to her six-bedroom bed and breakfast later this year.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The location helps us a lot,” Warburton said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hiring a staff of six has allowed her year-old business to flourish without the need for her to be on site all of the time. Warburton, currently spending a few months in the UK, pays her staff between $500 and $1,000 per month. That strategy allows her more freedom, but it’s also risky as it can be hard to find good staff.\n",
            "\n",
            "Figuring out the right place to buy can take several years. Snodgrass purchased her bed and breakfast after she had lived on St Thomas for five years. The Zocchis saw more 50 properties in the Tuscany area in Southern Italy over two years, before stumbling upon La Palazetta with their real estate agent. The property had been abandoned for 40 years and needed two years of renovation.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We bought it in two weeks,” Zocchi said.\n",
            "\n",
            "For those dreaming of a quaint life, keep in mind, running a bed and breakfast yourself might be more work than the day job you left. Days can run from the break of dawn until well after dinner and include preparing meals, cleaning rooms, advising guests and marketing work, said Snodgrass.\n",

            "Online review sites including TripAdvisor and Yelp can make a dramatic difference in boosting visitor rates so business owners must constantly work to improve feedback from guests and battle the competition.

The company is based in San Diego, but its largest holdings are in Kendall Square, where it has built 1.4 million square feet of space, owns 3.3 million square feet, and has another 63,000 square feet under construction.\n",
            "\n",
            "Globe reporter Robert Weisman spoke with BioMed president and chief operating officer Kent Griffin during a recent trip to Cambridge. Here’s what he learned:\n",
            "\n",
            "1Griffin, 44, who joined BioMed as chief financial officer in 2006, grew up in Jacksonville, Fla., graduated from Wake Forest University, and earned his MBA from the University of North Carolina. He has worked in commercial real estate financing in New York, San Francisco, and currently San Diego — but never in the Boston area. Despite the importance of Cambridge and Kendall Square to BioMed’s business, Griffin has no plans to move its headquarters east.\n",
            "\n",
            "“You have to be a tough cookie to withstand the Boston winters,” he said. “I don’t know if our whole team could stand the winters here.”\n",
            "\n",
            "2Griffin believes density rules in life sciences. BioMed owns and manages property in US medical technology hubs such as Greater Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and San Diego, as well as Cambridge, England. But Kendall Square offers the densest cluster of biopharmaceutical activity.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The life science industry is a global industry. But when you look at it from a macro picture, the United States still is the dominant provider of research and development globally, and Cambridge is the center of that. So because Cambridge is the center of the life science industry, it’s the center of our business. It is our largest market and represents over a third of our total portfolio. It’s a very tight concentrated location.”\n",
            "\n",
            "3BioMed owns and manages some of the highest profile Kendall Square biotechnology properties, including 500 Kendall St., the 349,000-square-foot headquarters of rare diseases giant Genzyme, now owned by French drug maker Sanofi SA. It also owns the Kendall Square Apartments with 37 rental units and the 350 East Kendall Street Garage containing 1,400 parking spaces.\n",

            "4Griffin thinks the life sciences boom still has a lot of running room, despite the recent choppiness in biotechnology stocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We are firm believers that the life sciences industry is going to grow faster than the broader economy. If you look at the biotech [stock] index as one data point, over the last three years it’s dramatically outperformed the broader S&P. In fact, if you look at commercial real estate in general, the markets where the life science industry is strong — Cambridge, San Francisco — those are the markets where commercial real estate in general is doing well.”\n",
            "\n",
            "5Griffin worries that steadily rising office prices may be pushing startups out of Cambridge, eroding a key foundation of the life sciences cluster. With Vertex Pharmaceuticals abandoning its warren of old industrial buildings to consolidate on the Boston waterfront, Griffin hopes to redevelop the property to accommodate companies from early stage to mature.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Part of what we hope to provide is space for the whole ecosystem.”\n",
            "\n",
            "6Griffin is watching the emergence of the Innovation District across the Charles River in Boston. But he is not yet sold on that area as an alternative to Kendall Square.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Our focus is Cambridge. The Fan Pier project [home to Vertex] is a great site, but I think most companies are going to continue to focus first on Cambridge. If they can’t find a home here, they may be forced to go across the river or out to the suburbs.”\n",

It comes near the end, when Imber, a renowned Somerville artist reduced to painting with a brush strapped to his hand, asks his college-age son, Gabe, for his take on several recent works.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of them is still on the easel. It’s a portrait — one of scores Imber painted in energetic, highly focused, and increasingly impeded sessions right up to his death last week at the age of 63.\n",
            "\n",
            "“What do you think?” he asks, his words already slurred by the disease, which causes nerves controlling voluntary muscles to atrophy. “Any of these grab you?”\n",
            "\n",
            "Gabe, a tall, good-looking kid who appears laid-back but reticent, has wandered in from outside the studio in Maine, where Imber and his wife are spending what they sense will be his final summer.\n",
            "\n",
            "“None of them grab me especially,” he says. “But they’re alright. They’re good.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Pressed for more, Gabe mutters something about one portrait’s “weird perspective” before concluding “It’s fine. I don’t love it.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Gabe’s brave — and, as I understood it — loving judgment is arrestingly out of tune (in a helpful way) with the rest of the film, which marshals old friends, art historians, and curators to lavish praise on Imber, and to explain what makes his late work so remarkable.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Jon Imber’s Left Hand” screens on Saturday at the Somerville Theater as part of the Independent Film Festival Boston. Produced and directed by Richard Kane, the film is generously sprinkled with images from all the different phases of Imber’s consistently impressive career. A protégé of the New York painter Philip Guston, he created early work that included monumental figure paintings of great tenderness and originality; his later work became increasingly abstracted, loosely brushed, and open — influenced both by Willem de Kooning and the Maine landscape he loved, wryly but deeply.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the film, Imber himself speaks with articulate honesty and fizzing passion about his work. His wife, the gifted and accomplished painter Jill Hoy, is full of insight; she warms the film from within. And there is lots of intelligent commentary from others.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Somehow,” notes Deborah Wye, a curator from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, “limitations actually can be liberating. I see that with Jon: The limitation has somehow given him another kind of road in to making a painting that I wouldn’t have expected.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But Gabe is having none of it. Off camera, we hear him again: “Everyone else is kind of afraid to say anything bad. No one’s gonna say anything, ’cept us.”\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s really the moment that makes this beautiful film, because it’s the toughest, the most honest.\n",
            "\n",
            "“Jon Imber’s Left Hand” is about more than the legacy of a painter. Instead — or so it seems at first — it’s about that painter’s decision to double down on art at a time when he could easily, and forgivably, have done the opposite.\n",
            "\n",
            "The response, in all who looked on, was admiration, esteem, and even — perversely — a kind of envy. ALS is a cruel disease, one that no one (as Imber himself often said) would wish on anyone. But watching this film, many will find themselves thinking, as I did, Would that I could die so well — with such courage, energy, integrity, and good humor – and so thoroughly loved.\n",
            "\n",
            "But of course the story of every death is layered. It looks one way from the outside. It looks different to insiders. And it looks different again — unimaginably so — to the one who is dying. Art and empathy can take us only so far.\n",
            "\n",
            "As someone who has probably been giving honest, trustworthy feedback to both his painter parents for much of his life, Gabe, one imagines — wandering in from the Maine gloaming, faced with a camera crew, an ailing father, and yet another painting on the easel — had his own priorities. It is beautiful to see him hold onto them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kane does a fine job knitting together the achievements of Imber’s career with the exceptional bravery (from the outside, it looked heroic) of his final two years. He gets over Imber’s infectious passion for painting and his many insights with an urgency and elan that are a pleasure to watch. He gives everything its proper weight.\n",
            "\n",
            "But in the end, I felt this was a film not about art but about love. Love, and a really remarkable family. At one point, Hoy worries aloud about Imber’s ability to cope when he can no longer paint. “Being a painter is who he is through and through,” she says.\n",
            "\n",
            "But a minute earlier, Imber (already drifting unnervingly into the past tense) has shaken up the whole film’s narrative by offering the thought that “being a parent was more important than being a painter.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“I’m gonna keep painting ’cause that’s what I do, it gives me pleasure,” he continues. “But I don’t necessarily think it’s what my life was all about. I’m a painter but I’m also a husband, a father and a friend, and my life like that has really felt very full, gratifying, and I don’t know if I need to paint to be who I am.”\n",
            "\n",
            "And at this point, you might just about be ready to cry.\n",

Do you sense pressure from other parents who might say, \"Why don't you just make her go in there?\" Because I've tried that and she just breaks down completely when she's not ready. And that's a horrible thing to see someone, you know, go through. Reporter: We notice her brother sitting in the den. He knows his sister is still tormented by fear. I'm curious what goes through your mind as you're watching your sibling struggle through this. We know that this isn't her fault, you know? I think that there's probably a point when she thought that we were blaming her for this. And that's definitely not the case. Reporter: He told us he's proud of his sister, and then he revealed something about his mother. How proud of his mother he is, too. Do you feel sorry for your mom at all, given what she's been through? Oh, well, I always knew, like, if anyone ever asked me, I would say that my mom is the nicest person in the world, and I'd, you know, stake my life on that. And it's definitely a difficult process for her and I think she's a great woman and I'm good -- I'm glad she's my mom. That's very nice. Becker, come here. Reporter: The whole family taking it one day at a time, all for Bridget. While for Michelle, that time has arrived, that prom she so feared. We snake our way through all of those kids looking for the 14-year-old who once couldn't get out of her own house, the teenager who couldn't step inside her own school. Now after all of that, on the other side of the dance floor, we found this. Michelle, dancing with her friends. And just outside, her mother, out of sight, wondering if her daughter is out of the woods. How is she doing? Reporter: She's tearing up the dance floor. No, really? Reporter: She's on the dance floor. Oh, that's a big thing for her. Reporter: Big smile. Oh, mom's proud. Reporter: Are you proud? Really proud. Reporter: And another moment we thought unimaginable when this journey began. Bridget getting into the front seat of the car with her mother, something she couldn't do just a few months ago. And where were they going? To the pool Bridget has so missed, the water she so loved as a little girl. We are about to try it again. Are you ready? I'm ready. Reporter: Bridget told us it is hard to believe she's here. What are you gonna show me, the butterfly? I'll show you some butterfly. Yep. Reporter: Show me how it's done. Yeah. Reporter: We were there the day you told Dr. Weg -- Mm-hmm. Reporter: -- That you were going through this therapy so that you could swim again. Yes. Reporter: And we're here. Yes, we are. Reporter: Should I time you? No. Reporter: That wouldn't be fair. We watched, and she was off. Bridget back in the pool. And that butterfly has come back to life. And for the mother who never gave up? I can't put it into words. It's just such a good feeling. Reporter: You've come a long way. Yes, I have. Reporter: But we all knew that day that this was just the first lap. We promised we would stick by them for the journey, and tonight, five years after we all first met, where is Bridget now? Where is Michelle who made it to that prom? And where is Rocco, so worried to leave his house? We go back for one more visit. And you're about to see a holiday weekend reunion we will never forget. ]\n",

            "Tod Marks, who covers shopping for Consumer Reports as “Tightwad Tod,” tried booking a Hertz economy car for two days in Charlotte, N.C. His best rate: $69. That jumped to $99 after four layers of taxes, concession and facility surcharges (imposed when renting at an airport), and a fee to recoup the cost of plates and registration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next came a pitch for other extras: a waiver to relieve Marks of responsibility for damage, theft, and loss of vehicle use, $58 for two days; supplemental liability insurance, $28; personal accident insurance/effects coverage to pay some medical bills and replace stolen items, $14; and emergency roadside assistance, $10. The new total: $209.\n",
            "\n",
            "How do you keep the bill from going through the sunroof? Consumer Reports asked experts for tips and invited its Facebook fans to share lessons from past rentals. The first rule: Plan ahead to avoid making decisions under pressure at the rental counter. Other advice:\n",
            "\n",
            "Shop early. Compare rates at rental car websites and on Expedia, Hotwire, and TripAdvisor. Airlines may offer a fly-and-drive discount, though in Consumer Reports’ experience it’s not steep. AAA, AARP, and Costco dangle deals, too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Contact your insurer. You may be adequately covered through your auto policy, says Jeanne Salvatore, senior vice president of the Insurance Information Institute. Check on collision and comprehensive coverage, and be sure you’re protected for the “full value” of a loss, plus “loss of use,” to offset revenue lost while a car is out of service. If there are coverage gaps, consider loss (or collision) coverage.\n",
            "\n",
            "Check your credit card. Some cards automatically provide secondary coverage for collision damage, after you have paid the deductible. For $25 per rental of up to 42 days, American Express offers more extensive protection (theft, damage, medical, no deductibles), and the insurance is primary — you don’t need to notify your insurer.\n",
            "\n",

            "Examine the car. “Inspect the car in a bright-light zone before leaving the lot and be as nitpicking as the rental company,” advised a Facebook fan who had to pay for a damaged wheel he failed to see before driving off a dark lot. Note damage on the contract, and have it signed before driving off. Take photos.\n",
            "\n",
            "Avoid penalties. Facebook posters reported penalties for canceling a reservation without ample notice, for returning a car more than a half-hour late or a few hours early, and for returning it to a different site.

            "Six-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer AmyÂ VanÂ Dyken severed her spine in an all-terrain vehicle accident over the weekend, and told emergency workers she could not move her toes or feel anything touching her legs. The 46-year-old swimmer, who goes by her married name VanÂ Dyken Rouen, was injured Friday. She was airlifted to a hospital and had surgery to stabilize her spine. Hospital spokeswoman Alice Giedraitis didn't provide details Monday on Rouen's injuries. She said the swimmer was in good condition. A letter from the VanÂ Dyken and Rouen families said she severed her spinal cord at the T11 vertebrae and that the broken vertebrae came within millimeters of rupturing her aorta. A report by the Show Low Police Department said the ATV that Rouen was driving hit a curb in a restaurant parking lot and sent her over a drop-off between 5 to 7 feet. Rouen was found lying on the ground next to the ATV. She was strapped to a backboard and airlifted to Scottsdale Osborn Medical Center. A witness said he saw Rouen launch over the curb and found her unresponsive when he arrived on the scene, the report said. Rouen was not wearing a helmet at the time. Her husband, former Denver Broncos punter Tom Rouen, told police officers he had changed the throttle mechanism on the ATV from a thumb accelerator to a twist accelerator a few days before the accident, though wasn't sure if it was a factor in the accident. He said his wife had not been drinking alcohol that evening. Rouen starred at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where she became the first U.S. female athlete to win four gold medals in a single games. She captured the 50-meter freestyle and 100 butterfly and also competed on the winning relay teams in the 400 free and 400 medley. Four years later at Sydney, she added two more golds in the 400 free and 400 medley relays before retiring from competition. In 2003, she was among numerous prominent athletes who testified before a grand jury investigating the BALCO doping scandal. Rouen never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during her career. \"The USA Swimming family is devastated to learn of AmyÂ VanÂ Dyken's unfortunate accident this weekend,\" the organization said in a statement. \"We're happy to hear that she escaped and is now in great care. That she is already 'acting like her typical spunky, boisterous, ebullient self' shows she's on a great path.\" \"Amy is a champion who has proven throughout her life that she is a fighter who takes on challenges and comes out on top. We know Amy will tackle her rehabilitation with vigor and be back on her feet sooner rather than later,\" it said.\n",

            "The organza that forms the backcloth to Jessica Rankin's embroideries barely seems able to take the weight of her glittering metallic threads. It's as fine as mist, as fragile and apparently insubstantial as thought. Yet this gossamer material can support cascades of loose, twirling gold and quartz-coloured silks, carefully sewn scraps of landscapes, stitched star maps and black, blocky words. Surreal, collaged snatches of overheard chatter, quotes from books, or Rankin's own fleeting reflections appear without pause: THINANDSKYSTRETCHES; EARLYDARK; SHALL END IT.\n",
            "\n",
            "Abstract and landscape painting are two comparisons frequently levied at the Australian-born, New York and Berlin-based artist's embroideries; so too are concrete poetry and Chinese calligraphy, forms of writing where the visual quality is as important as what's being said. Born in Sydney in 1971 to a poet mother and painter father (David Rankin), her interest in words and abstraction date back to her childhood, although she was first taught to sew by her babysitter. She turned back to embroidery after graduating from art school in the US, building on the innovations of 70s feminists who'd brought new life to traditional women's work, developing her own distinctive voice at the same time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Needlework might be methodical and repetitive, but it's great for letting the mind wander. Tapping into this, Rankin's embroideries are like mental maps, working through recollections, impressions of places and immediate experience. In her early work Hinterland, from 2007, words fall vertically down the canvas like spider's threads beneath the outline of mountains; here, she also weaved together reminiscences of a trip to the Australian countryside, her son's drawings of train tracks and the experience of creating the embroidery in a barn full of creepy crawlies. It comes on like memory, a tumble of language and images – but slowly and painstakingly realised by the sewer's hand.\n",
            "\n",
            "Why we like her: For her current show, Skyfolds 1941-2010, which is full of glimmering silvery embroidery that suggests torrential downpours, ghostly visions or abstract expressionist paintings. By contrast, vast works on paper, such as A Line in the Air, resemble embroidery but turn out to be drawings. Dense patches of circular pencil marks accumulate around tiny bare white dots, like a thicket of gorse, a cloud, fungus spores or the dark universe brooding between the stars.\n",
            "\n",
            "Pot boilers: Rankin's been inspired by all sorts of writing, from Apollinaire to the ghost stories of MR James and Chinese scrolls. One of her major touchstones, though, is Lunch Poems by the New York school figurehead and art critic Frank O'Hara. This brilliant collection of impressionistic verse – meshing reflections on pop, city life and art – was written during, and with a view to be easily read, in the lunch break.\n",

            "artcle: 24 SimpleReach, a New York-based content marketing startup that tracks how information spreads on the Internet, among other things, has raised a $9 million in funding to further develop its product and expand its team. MK Capital led the Series A round with investments from Atlas Venture, Village Ventures, and High Peaks Venture Partners.\n",
            "\n",
            "The funding comes as venture investors pour money into the content marketing category in hot pursuit of advertising dollars. (Native advertising pulled in an estimated $2.4 billion last year, moving the category from “experimental” to become a permanent line item on many advertisers’ budgets.) Earlier this year, the sponsored content company NewsCred raised $25 million, bringing its total funding to $46.8 million. Contently and Percolate, other competitors, have raised $12.3 million and $34.5 million, respectively. All three startups compete in the category with slightly differentiated offerings. SimpleReach’s position is that it offers marketers a single performance report for all of its branded content, spanning several sites and social media channels.\n",
            "\n",
            "SimpleReach can also claim something few of its competitors can: it was founded four years ago, long before venture capitalist Fred Wilson coined “native advertising” and marketers and publishers became obsessed with the term. SimpleReach was doing native advertising before native advertising was cool.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, that’s no guarantee of success. (As startup wisdom goes: “Being early is the same as being wrong.”) SimpleReach almost didn’t live to see the heyday of native advertising. “We were close to death several times because we were too early to the market,” founder Edward Kim says. “We nearly ran out of money a lot of times.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The company’s pitch hasn’t changed, but SimpleReach didn’t get the time of day from publishers or brands in its early years. “[We] had to scrape by with super small checks, trying to stay alive month to month,” Kim says. Times have changed. Several hundred publishers now use the company’s sponsored content platform, which costs about $2,500 per month for brands to access the most basic version. (SimpleReach also takes a cut of any paid promotions of the content.) Forbes, which was early to move into branded content, was its first client. Publications including the New York Times, Huffington Post, The Atlantic and yes, even, Fortune, followed suit. Media buyers such as DigitasLBi and VivaKi, as well as companies like Intel, are spending money to promote their content through SimpleReach.\n",
            "\n",
            "The company has grown to 25 employees, mostly on its own income. (It raised $3.1 million across several seed rounds.) The company will now enjoy additional capital to expand its product. The “next generation” of content measurement and distribution, according to SimpleReach, is being able to show actual return on investment on content for advertisers and brands.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kim views content marketing as in its early days, even though he’s been doing it for four years. First, the industry was focused on content creation, he says; the next step, just like what happened with online video, is that people realize they need distribution. “In the early innings, people are focused on routing money into workflow management and creating the content. Now people have [that] and it’s like, wait a minute, nobody is reading this,” he says. Surprise: That’s where SimpleReach steps in.\n",
            "\n",
            "And what of reports that readers say they hate sponsored content and native advertising? Kim recites the same line most native advertising advocates tout—disclosure is everything!—but also clarifies why native advertising is considered in recent years as The One True Answer to both publishers and advertisers: It’s the only thing left. “It’s the answer by process of elimination,” he says. Banners don’t work on tiny mobile screens, so advertisers have to get users’ attention in the main stream of content with native and sponsored content. Still, that disclosure thing is tricky. “If you are publisher, this is both the greatest thing to happen to you and also most dangerous thing to happen to you,” he says.\n",

All told, the executive MBA program consists of a dozen required courses, each 10 weeks long, delivered online with “synchronous opportunities” (Translation: You can do the class in real time if you’re able to). Besides the quarterly Q&A videoconferences with Welch, video messages from him populate the school’s website and he’ll often respond to half a dozen messages on the bulletin boards two or three times each term.\n",

            "At a time when many business schools are reporting declining enrollment in their full-time MBA programs, Welch’s Management Institute is doing a brisk business. The institute currently has 538 active students, up by a healthy 36% in the past year. But Welch is far more ambitious, having a stated goal to enroll 5,000 students within five years, far eclipsing Harvard’s 1,800 MBA candidates or Stanford Graduate School of Business’ 800 students.\n",
            "\n",
            "Students say they are drawn to the program because of Welch’s name and reputation, the flexibility of studying online, and the low cost of the program. At $36,000, it’s considerably less expensive than the online offerings of highly ranked business schools, such as Indiana University, the University of North Carolina, and Carnegie Mellon, where the total cost ranges between $60,000 and $118,000.\n",

Thompson says she has taken classes from hotel rooms in Dallas, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Chicago, New York, and Orlando — as well as from numerous airplanes 35,000 feet in the sky. “Thank God for GoGo Internet,” she laughs.\n",
            "\n",
            "What differentiates this online program from many others is its emphasis on the pragmatic. The curriculum is infused with Welch’s core beliefs and ideas on business, from the importance of candor in managing employees to the more controversial differentiation policies he made famous at GE GE . Welch wants the students, as he puts it, to “learn it on Monday, apply it on Tuesday, and share it on Friday.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The courses most heavily influenced by Welch’s teachings are Leadership In The 21st Century, Strategy, and People Management. Those so-called signature courses come early in the curriculum, which ends with a capstone business simulation done with virtual teams of students. The program can be completed from a computer anywhere in the world — from a hotel room to an airplane flight — in two years. Most students, however, take one course at a time, requiring anywhere from 15 to 20 hours of work a week, which would allow them to pass through the program in two-and-a-half years.\n",
            "\n",
            "The institute itself is run like a business, not an academic enterprise. Welch is constantly asking students what they think of the program and how it can be improved. He treats them as customers as well as students. He also keeps close tabs on the institute’s “net promoter score” (NPS) — used to gauge the loyalty of a firm’s customer relationships. The institute claims a highly impressive score of 65% which would put it in a class that includes such companies as Apple AAPL and Google GOOG . The average is 10% to 15%.\n",
            "\n",
            "Customer satisfaction surveys at the institute are as common as final exams. “They ought to know that when they fill out a survey we are all over it,” insists Welch. “We look at that NPS score like an animal. We want to find out every detail about it and we want to fix something whenever we have a score that is not at the top of the range. Everybody at our school is measured on it.”\n",
            "\n",

Perhaps even more surprising, 54% of the responding students said they have received a promotion, a raise, or some professional recognition since they started the program. One in four students said they are achieving significant career advancement since starting the Welch MBA.\n",

After two years, he moved the institute to Strayer Education Inc., a stronger player with deeper resources in the for-profit education market. So far, there are more than 130 graduates of the program.\n",

            "It goes without saying that this is not anything like a two-year MBA with a summer internship that lines up a student for a new job at graduation. Online MBA programs are best suited for managers who want to learn the business basics and who generally want to advance in their own organizations. A Welch MBA won’t have the cache of the imprimatur of a Cornell, Dartmouth, Yale, or Harvard degree. After all, applicants to Welch’s institute do not have to take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) to get into the program, although they must have five years of professional experience and a 3.0 undergraduate GPA.\n",

            "What of the often-stated notion that online learning is hardly equal to on-campus study? “Even the best schools are moving into the online space,” argues Andrea Backman, dean of the institute, who has worked in the distance learning at DePaul University and the University of Virginia. “People aren’t going to want to sit in a lecture hall for two years.”\n",
            "\n",
            "When Welch recruited Backman from the University of Virginia, where she was director of online and off-grounds programs, earlier this year, she asked him why he was so interested in online business education. “I’m not in it to make money,” she recalls Welch saying, “‘but I want to rid the world of bad managers and I don’t think there is a program out there that does this.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Just how involved is Welch in this enterprise? “He is incredibly involved and students have access to him,” says Backman. “I was hoping when I made the move that I would have a lot of interaction with Jack and get to learn from him. That has been 100% the case. The ability to get coached by Jack is way more than I anticipated.”\n",

            "When Thompson signed up for the program, she was initially concerned about whether she could bond with fellow students and faculty who were not in the same room. “It is a virtual experience but it is still intimate,” she says now. “I’m a very social person and that was important to me.”\n",

In typical Welch tough-love fashion, he told the manager to buck up and take the heat. “You have to sit back and show the person giving you the candor that you are receptive and that you are not trying to get ready on the edge of your chair to combat the arguments,” Welch instructed. “The only person that counts in this discussion is your boss. You have to show your boss that you are wide open to suggestions and you really want to learn. Suck it up and try to deal with the criticisms, even if you don’t think they are valid.”\n",

            "artcle: 26 “And So It Goes” is the title of Rob Reiner’s new movie, but it might as well be a eulogy for his career. Not that he seems very upset about it. There he is in this low-budget geriatric farce, rocking an ironically hideous toupee in a supporting role and grinning away — the director who once gave us “This Is Spinal Tap,” “Stand By Me,” “The Sure Thing,” “When Harry Met Sally,” all of them class entertainments and one of them (”Tap”) a bona fide classic.\n",

In one scene she spies another character and calls out, “Woo-woo! Woo-woo!” Who even says “woo-woo” anymore? And why don’t they?\n",

            "“And So It Goes” looks like it was shot on outdated video equipment and has a forced, jokey script by Mark Andrus (”As Good As It Gets,” “Georgia Rule”). It convincingly paints Oren as someone you would never, ever want to meet. What he needs, of course, is a granddaughter he didn’t know he had, deposited on Oren’s doorstep by son Luke (Scott Shepherd), a former addict turned stand-up businessman who’s going to jail for a white-collar crime he didn’t commit. (Because any actual malfeasance on his part would spoil the movie’s black-and-white moral calculus.) “Heroin’s an ugly drug, but it gave me a beautiful girl,” says Luke.\n",

            "The girl, Sarah (Sterling Jerins), is a shy 10-year-old who takes one look at Oren and flees to neighbor Leah, whom she quickly dubs “Grandma.” And so begins the slow, sweet, obvious process of this Scrooge becoming human again. The journey involves dogs humping giant teddy bears, tenants giving birth on Oren’s couch, and one jarring, tone-deaf scene in which the hero locates Sarah’s junkie mother (Meryl Williams) in a — gasp — poor neighborhood, only to snatch the girl back after the mom becomes distraught from seeing her child for the first time in years. They leave her writhing on the sidewalk and hit the rides at an amusement park. No harm, no foul.\n",

            "There are a lot of jokes about geriatric whoopee — Oren’s idea of making a pass is “The last time I had sex, I tore my ACL” — and a daft little subplot about Leah’s sideline as a cabaret singer. The early sequences are as charming as “And So It Goes” gets, Keaton warbling “Cheek to Cheek” before bursting into tears at the thought of her late husband. That’s the act. Then Oren takes over as her manager, gets her to loosen up and be “as the kids say, ‘cray,’ ” and soon Leah is crooning Bonnie Raitt’s “Something to Talk About” in a club owned by Frankie Valli. I don’t know about you, but I liked the character better when she was a mess.\n",

            "They knew, like so many others who have defaulted, that student loans really never go away. Having them is like being in a debtor’s prison.\n",
            "\n",
            "But there is hope for those who think they have fallen hopelessly behind. As of July 1, borrowers in default have to be offered a standardized payment option to rehabilitate their defaulted loans.\n",
            "\n",
            "Default has serious financial consequences. You can lose eligibility for deferment, forbearance, and access to more affordable repayment plans. The government can snatch your federal and state tax refunds. And a default can severely damage your credit rating. A default occurs when you fail to make a payment for 270 days.\n",
            "\n",
            "Under new Department of Education rules, a borrower can qualify to rehabilitate defaulted federal loans by making nine voluntary on-time and full monthly payments over 10 consecutive months. (The extra month allows a borrower to be late on a payment and still qualify.) The rules apply only to federally guaranteed student loans.\n",
            "\n",
            "Loan rehabilitation was supposed to be “reasonable and affordable,” based on a borrower’s financial circumstances. Except there was no clear definition of what reasonable and affordable meant. Payments varied among lenders. In some cases, those payments were calculated based on a percentage of the outstanding loan balance, typically 1 percent. As a result, many borrowers complained that their rehabilitation payments were unreasonable and unaffordable.\n",
            "\n",
            "“The change is intended to make sure everyone is treated the same way,” said Betsy Mayotte, director of regulatory compliance for American Student Assistance, a nonprofit that aims to help people manage and repay their college loan debt. “A default rehab was supposed to be based on people’s financial circumstance rather than their balances.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Under the new rule, the rehab formula is based on the one used for the federal Income-Based Repayment program, or IBR. This plan allows borrowers with federal student loans to have their monthly payments set to a reasonable amount based on their income, family size, and state of residence. So like an IBR, a loan rehabilitation payment is equal to 15 percent of adjusted gross income that exceeds 150 percent of the federal poverty guideline.\n",
            "\n",
            "American Student Assistance has a rehabilitation calculator on its website.\n",
            "\n",
            "Using the 15 percent formula, let’s say a borrower and spouse have an adjusted annual income of $35,000. The monthly rehab payment would be about $143. But that same borrower in a family of four would pay just $5. Their family size helped lower the payment to the minimum.\n",
            "\n",
            "Keep in mind that you’ll have to figure out how to make your regular payments after you get out of rehab. Also, while the calculation is similar to the one used under IBR, you’ll still need to apply for IBR or another payment option if you still need a lower payment amount once you rehabilitate your loan, Mayotte pointed out.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you apply for rehabilitation and find that the payment is too high, you can fill out a form to have the loan holder consider an even lower payment by considering in more detail your income and expenses.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ask your lender for the financial disclosure form, or search online for “financial disclosure for reasonable and affordable rehabilitation payments.”\n",
            "\n",
            "If you are being forced to make payments because of a wage garnishment, such payments do not count toward your rehabilitation payments. However, an order can be suspended if you make the first five voluntary payments under rehab, Mayotte said. It’s also possible that the loan holder may adjust the garnishment amount to help make the voluntary payments manageable, she said.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It stands to reason that a lot of people didn’t try to get out of default because they didn’t know what to expect,” Mayotte said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regarding the soon-to-be-released inmates, Mayotte suggested that they resolve the defaulted loans right away — either through rehab or consolidation.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I would hate to see them obtain employment, only for the new employer to receive a garnishment order,” she said.\n",
            "\n",
            "“If they resolve the default before obtaining employment, they can apply for an unemployment deferment or economic hardship or even income-based repayment.”\n",

            "artcle: 30 The Great Hall at Target’s Minneapolis headquarters was bustling this morning. Usually a low-key place where employees sip coffee, hold relaxed meetings and take a few minutes of R&R, this morning there was a line about 200 people long, according to Dustee Jenkins, Target’s vice-president for public relations. They were there to meet Brian Cornell, who this morning was named Target’s new CEO and showed up in the Great Hall for an impromptu meet and greet, though he won’t officially start until Aug. 12. “It has been absolutely electric,” Cornell says in an exclusive phone interview from the Hall. “There’s a really fun, positive energy here. It’s great to meet so many employees.” He posed for selfies, shook hands, and tried to set a tone of openness—a marked change from his predecessor, Gregg Steinhafel, who was not known for socializing with the rank and file (or talking to the press, for that matter).\n",
            "\n",
            "The first outsider to take the job in the company’s history, Cornell, 55, joins from PepsiCo, where he was head of the snack-and-soda giant’s $25 billion Americas Foods division. He also did stints running Sam’s Club and Michael’s Stores, and once held a senior position at Safeway. Says Frank Blake, who knew him when he served on Home Depot’s board: “I’m a big fan of Brian’s. He’s a terrific business executive and leader and was a great contributor to Home Depot.” Says another executive who knows him well: “Everywhere he’s gone, he’s made a huge difference.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Cornell will need to make a huge difference at Target, which has been stuck in a rut for a few years now. Not only have same-store-sales declined, but an enormous security breach rocked the company’s credibility last December. That, a disastrous expansion into Canada, and internal tensions led to Steinhafel’s unceremonious ouster in May. The company’s stock has slumped over the past year.\n",

            "The CEO search, which was led by Korn Ferry and completed in three months—incredibly quick for a search of this caliber–included both insiders and outsiders. Jenkins says Cornell’s leadership skills ultimately swayed the board of directors. “We wanted someone transformational, someone who understood retail,” she says. Yet retail expert Robin Lewis notes that Cornell is really more of a packaged goods specialist, and that the track record of outsiders in the retail business is not great. “The risk is bringing an industry outsider into an industry that is much more complicated.”\n",

            "Cornell’s departure may also be a blow for PepsiCo, which reportedly had been considering him as a potential successor to CEO Indra Nooyi. But over in Minneapolis, Cornell seems to be garnering some goodwill in the Great Hall, at least today. Here’s hoping it lasts.\n",

            "First up: Howard Schatz’s At The Fights: Inside The World of Professional Boxing. An 11-by-14-inch work of art that weighs in at a healthy seven pounds, six ounces, it includes 320 photos of current and former boxers and interviews with more than 50 boxing insiders. It’s a one-two punch that anyone with the slightest interest in photography or the sport of boxing should be thrilled to find in his or her stocking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Schatz devoted six years to the book. As multi-talented as you can get, he spent 23 years as a retina specialist, clinician, and professor of ophthalmology before swapping his medical practice in San Francisco for a photography studio in New York. That was in 1995. Since then he’s won dozens of prestigious photography awards. His work appears regularly in Harper’s Bazaar, Sports Illustrated, Vogue, and other major publications. (At the Fights was produced by Sports Illustrated Books. Sports Illustrated and Fortune are both published by Time Inc.) Assisted by his wife Beverly J. Ornstein, he has also created a small library of books.\n",
            "\n",
            "At The Fights, his 19th published work, grew out of an earlier book that focused on athletes in general. “When I was working on it,” Schatz says, “I saw how different boxers are from other athletes. The courage to box is beyond anything I can understand. It is fascinating.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Schatz’s interview subjects include trainers, judges, referees, managers, promoters, writers, announcers, commissioners, and physicians. Brutality is a common thread. So are skill and performance. “You can see a million guys go 20 or 30 minutes shooting basketballs,” says Emanuel Steward, a trainer, “but nothing is as devastating as seeing someone who can slip and slide punches.”\n",

            "Nigel Collins, an ESPN analyst and former editor of The Ring magazine, provides another perspective: “I love boxing. If you’re in love with a dangerous woman, it’s very exciting. But because you know the facts about that woman doesn’t make you stop loving her. That’s how boxing is with me.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The fighters have their say. “To me, boxing is the most gentlemanly sport there is,” says heavyweight Chris Arreola. “There’s two guys that don’t know each other, go in the ring, beat the living shit out of each other, and after they’re done they shake hands like nothing ever happened. I don’t hate the guy, and he doesn’t hate me. We both know it’s a sport, and you both know you’re going to go home and kiss your kids.”\n",
            "\n",
            "As good as the words are, the pictures tell the tale, including powerful shots taken at ringside. Schatz is a studio photographer at heart, however, and he convinced most of his subjects to visit him at his place of work. “My major goal,” says Schatz, “was to use each boxer to make art, to create remarkable and unique images that surprised and delighted me.”\n",
            "\n",
            "He does that and more, starting with straightforward studio portraits and moving on to kinetic action shots. Schatz gets amazing results by dousing boxers with water or having them punch their way through sheets of salt and powder. And his stroboscopic multiple exposures of fighters jumping rope and hitting a punching bag are out of sight.\n",

The second consists of time-lapse photos that record the changes the glaciers experienced over a six-year period.\n",
            "\n",
            "To make it happen, Balog and his team embedded some 40 cameras in strategic spots in and around the glaciers. Programmed to take one picture during every half hour of daylight, year-round, the cameras recorded roughly 8,000 frames a year, working through temperatures that dropped to minus 35 degrees Fahrenheit, winds of up to 160 miles per hour, dozens of feet of snow, torrential rain, rock falls and more.\n",

            "“We are in the midst of a gigantic, unplanned, uncontrolled experiment involving the entire planet,” Balog says in the introduction. His time-lapse photos provide stark and irrefutable evidence of what the results of climate change look like. A similar story is told in Chasing Ice, a feature-length documentary that Balog and his team produced about their work. It brings the melting glaciers pictured in the book to the big screen. The film, which opened earlier this month, just might make it to the Oscars.\n",
            "\n",
            "Balog is an award-winning photographer who has produced five other books and shoots for publications like National Geographic and Vanity Fair. He started work on Ice following a 2005 New Yorker assignment to photograph Icelandic glaciers. In addition to making an environmental point, the photos in the book display the grandeur and majesty of centuries-old ice and snow sculptures in a way I’ve never seen. Many are breathtakingly beautiful.\n",

Kimbrough is actually a cyber security technician for the government and does the same job as a Marine Corps Reservist. He talked about preparing for the world’s shift from IPv4 to IPv6—and the inevitable new batch of hacks that would arise from it—by leading the students through some exercises with Wireshark, a program that allows you to see network activity at a microscopic level, and an intrusion detection system called Snort.\n",

A smallish but satisfying example is in Chastleton House in the Cotswolds, built by a rich wool merchant (or possibly lawyer), whose family later dissipated his wealth and so were unable to alter the original building. Nikolaus Pevsner called the decoration of Chastleton \"blatantly nouveau riche, even barbaric, uninhibited by any consideration of insipid good taste\", but it now it looks gentle and charming, softened by wobbles in wood and plaster and the fall of light. It is also more bare than it would have been, in the absence of its original artworks and tapestries. What is particularly pleasurable is the way the stuff of the ceiling – ornamental plaster – descends, while the stuff of the floor – wood – rises in the form of panelling and the two meet at mid-height.

The program seems right for the time. We have globalization on all fronts including the globalization of “communities.” Think about it. While social relationships and values and “mentoring” used to spring out of physically cohesive groups of people connecting according to commonalities (beliefs about God, job types, organizations), connecting this way too often meant a senior Caucasian man taking a junior Caucasian man “under his wing.”\n",

The mentors in this totem pole included venture capitalists Ann Winblad and Heidi Roizen, politician Sally Lieber, Google GOOG executives Susan Wojcicki and Megan Smith, Intel CIO Diane Bryant, and women at Apple , eBay , Cisco , Palm (PALM), and even Wal-Mart …plus lawyers and judges, chefs, government employees, and all sorts of entrepreneurs.\n",

            "Before Susan arrived, she asked me to sign her up for the gym, as she feared having too much free time and being bored. The only time she went to the gym was at 6 a.m. one day. She was anything but “bored.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Susan arrived into the U.S. with a passion for what she could do for her community and left with the passion for exploring what her community could do for her. In the one year since her return, she has called on the community in Silicon Valley to buy a bus for her children so that they can safely travel to school. We collected $43,800 for Susan, and she bought her bus.\n",

Indeed, next month’s news may prove more newsworthy than years past if some of the speculation is right. Will Apple AAPL finally introduce a new, cheaper iPhone? Could the high-end model sport fingerprint-sensing technology? What else is in store?\n",

            "\n",
            "Truth or misguided gossip? Analysts, pundits, and blogs have long talked about a new, “cheap” — largely dubbed in the press as the iPhone 5C — iPhone for over a year now. Last January, Topeka Capital Markets analyst Brian White told Fortune that there’s substantial market opportunity abroad in China for such a product, where the average consumer doesn’t have as large a discretionary income. More recently, Piper Jaffray’s Gene Munster suggested such a device would replace the older 4S model and possibly exclude software features like the voice-activated assistant Siri.\n",
            "\n",
            "When Apple acquired fingerprint-sensor maker AuthenTec Inc. for $350 million last year, some wondered how such technology could find its way into iPhones, iPads and the like. KGI Securities argues the new high-end iPhone — let’s just call it the iPhone 5S — will integrate a sensor allowing users to potentially log in by simply pressing a finger to the screen. A security feature like that would prove even quicker, easier, and more secure than the current method of inputting a four-digit code.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once in a while, Apple likes to get colorful. (Look no further than today’s iPod Touch or iPod nano as proof.) The buzz around the crop of iPhones is that they may come in flavors other than black and white, which let’s face it, aren’t even technically colors, according to scientists. The 5C could come in an array of hues not unlike the Touch or nano; the 5S could expand to models with a gold frame.\n",
            "\n",
            "When Apple announced the iPhone 5 last fall, Jony Ive, senior vice president of design, explained why 4 inches was a sweet spot: “By making the screen taller, but not wider, you can see more of your content but still comfortably use it with one hand.” But as devices from competitors bear out, there’s a large swath of users who prefer their smartphones screens even larger . To wit, although sales of Samsung’s 5-inch Galaxy S4 are lower than analysts expected, the company still sold 10 million units within a month of launch. In Apple’s case, reports claim the new iPhone — or at least one iPhone — may sport a screen between 4.5- to 5-inches.\n",

            "Some bloggers are calling for the end of the iPod Touch entirely, but more likely than not, Apple won’t kill its iPhone-like music player any time soon. This May, Apple reported it had sold 100 million units since the Touch hit the market in late 2007. Clearly, demand for the device is still there, so chances are Apple will introduce a new Touch with slightly-beefed up parts inside, keeping in lockstep with the company’s oft-held tradition of tossing in a Jobs-ian “one more thing” toward the end.\n",

A heady mix of diesel fumes, brake dust and the breeze along the Thames, maybe, but to the new government's chief spin doctor, it would have smelt like... victory. The Labour party - New Labour - had been returned to power, after 18 cold years, with a majority of 179. \"Operation Victory\", Labour's pugnacious election campaign, had been fought and spun as much in the party's new headquarters, a floor in Millbank Tower - a shiny, Grade II listed 60s skyscraper overlooking the Tate Gallery on one side, the Palace of Westminster on the other - as it had been on hustings and in the press.\n",

In five intense years, its Thamesside HQ has served its purpose well: a machine for making Labour electable and capable of government. A decade earlier, the squabbling party had seemed all but washed-up and incapable of winning.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Those were the days of Walworth Road,\" says Mandelson, of Labour's former headquarters housed in a rabbit-warren of historic buildings in the shadowlands of Elephant & Castle in south-east London. \"I first went there as director of campaigns and communications in 1985. I was sat down in a wobbly, revolving chair at a three-legged desk with a spider plant and a second world war-style phone. The place was dominated by the policy department, which specialised in mass-producing election-losing policies. I'd been there about six months when I came across an office I'd never noticed before. It was, I learned, a part of my department. Inside, I met a chap who said he was the 'sign-writer'. He painted very nice signs, but said it wasn't really a full-time job; so, he ran a small import-export business from the office on the side... believe me, we really did have to modernise, there and then, or melt down completely.\"\n",

            "All of which explains the move to Millbank. Millbank Tower - originally Vickers Tower - was designed by Ronald Ward and Partners and completed in 1963. It was everything the Labour party offices on Walworth Road in the early 1990s were not: tall, gleaming, sleek, modern, aloof and close to the heart of power. Its 32 storeys were topped with a plethora of communications equipment. It was long a favourite location for filming episodes of Dr Who.\n",

            "Millbank Tower owes nothing to the history of the street it rises from, nor to local architectural styles. It might have been equally at home rising above the streetscapes of Frankfurt or Brussels. A clean break with history, it was, at 387ft high, one of the very first buildings in London to rise higher than St Paul's; an overt symbol of a newly confident free-market economy and one that went, hand in slippery hand, with the removal of historic planning controls.\n",

Their one major earlier work was the slick, 260ft high St George's House, Croydon, the refurbished UK headquarters of Nestle today. Buildings such as Millbank Tower and its contemporary, Euston Tower, were meant to be domineering, yet at the same time all but anonymous command posts of both the embyronic computer age and of burgeoning global capitalism. It was almost waiting for New Labour to come its way.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rising from the glazed lobby, lifts gave access to floors lined for the most part with neat rows of cellular offices. When New Labour moved in, office partitions were stripped away. The new headquarters - a cool, simply designed space - was to be open-plan. Not only could everyone communicate with one another easily, everyone could be watched. This was a perfect home for anyone who wished to control and dominate. Within months, Millbank was known as the centre of government spin and control. MPs were paged from the new command centre; the whole party, electronically tagged, was on-message, on-line.\n",

            "After his victory in the 1964 general election, Harold Wilson had moved the new National Economic Development Council, an alliance of government, business, unions and academia, into the tower. They conspired here to launch Britain into the era of what Wilson and his postmaster general, Anthony Wedgewood Benn, liked to call white-hot technology, and to plan and control its economy. Curiously, it was at this time that the government, and its enemies within MI5 and elsewhere, became obsessed with conspiracies and spies. Perhaps appropriately, Millbank Tower had opened as From Russia With Love premiered in the West End.\n",

This image appeals to the many journalists who have depicted Mandelson's Millbank as the dark, furtive and controlling heart of New Labour. For political correspondents such as BBC's Nick Jones, author of The Control Freaks, \"the very word Millbank has come to mean a sinister place\".\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Journalists have never been welcome here,\" says Jones. \"I've long liked to imagine Mandelson in a dark cloak in Millbank at night, spinning the mystery of the New Labour message, teaching his baby vampires the dark political arts of control and manipulation of news, before they fly off, gorged, to lucrative roosts in political consultancies, media companies and public relations.

            "Jones is teasing - up to a point. Yet the word Millbank struck fear in Londoners' hearts long before politics' Prince of Darkness came here to spin and foil his opponents. The Millbank Penitentiary, based crudely on the reformist ideals of the political philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, brooded here from 1821 to 1903. In the 19th century, Millbank spelt control, surveillance and locked doors. It did again, for journalists at least, at the end of the 20th century.\n",

            "Deep inside Millbank Tower, so the legend went, whirred the mighty Excalibur, a computer possibly even nastier than Hal, dark star of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Excalibur was an intelligence gatherering machine that kept tabs on national and international news.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the mythical world of Millbank, Mandelson presided over this evil engine like the Wizard of Oz. Attended by 10 hand-picked acolytes, Excalibur was the machine by which he would turn Tony Blair into Britain's first, all-seeing, all-knowing president.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"What a lot of tosh,\" says Mandelson. \"Excalibur was a news gathering program. We live in a world hungry for news; Excalibur was a database of tens of thousands of press cuttings. Since McLuhan, we've all known that the media is the message, and the massage. In the lead-up to the 1997 election, we needed to be acutely aware of what was going on, what was being said. We had to sharpen our act, and we did. All the talk of skullduggery is plain silly.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The press found it hard to believe we had become so good at our jobs\", says David Hill, Labour's chief media spokesman from 1993 to 98, and now a director of Good Relations, a London-based PR firm. \"Some of them wanted to believe that we'd invested in some sort of all-intrusive machine, something from a James Bond film. The turning point for us was in November 1996. The Tories issued a report in the morning, putting a blow-by-blow cost on the likely spending plans of a future Labour government; by 6pm, we were able to issue a rebuttal, a counter-report, that proved them wrong on every one of 80 or 90 points. We couldn't have done that without an enormous amount of readily get-attable material; that's what Excalibur was all about. There was no mystery, just hard work, speed and the kind of professionalism that was new to European politics.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Even so, Millbank's talk of an \"Opposition Watch\", of an \"Attack/Rebuttal Task Force\", of a \"Media Monitoring Unit\", and even a campaign \"war room\" for 1997's Operation Victory, and of the very real bullying of journalists that went on in the first two or three years of Blair's government, gave the place a special, gargoyled nook in the annals of British political history.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Realistically, you have to see where we were coming from,\" says Mandelson. \"I remember attending a transport policy sub-committee meeting of the National Executive Committee of the TUC at Transport House, the Labour party HQ before the Walworth Road rabbit-warren. This was in the 70s. I was working as an assistant in the economics department of the TUC. Bill Rogers, the secretary of state responsible for transport at the time, was pushing an innovative proposal for road-rail freight interchanges. The door flew open. In came Jack Jones and three other trade union officials. They sat down. Jones said they took exception to the policy. They didn't want it. And here's the extraordinary thing; when challenged, Jones said: 'We're the landlords here; we want it off the agenda.' This was a defining moment in my politics. The Labour party had long shared premises with the unions, but surely the relationship between them had got too close for comfort?\"\n",

            "Although the party's next home, Walworth Road, was the backdrop to the epic struggle between the modernisers and the old left, it never evoked as clear an image, or political style, as its successor. Remarkably, the irony that Millbank Tower just happens to stand on the site of the house Tony Benn was born in passed most of the apparatchiks by. \"I think it [Millbank] was very good in its time,\" said David Triesman, General Secretary of the Labour Party, talking to BBC Radio Four's The Westminster Hour earlier this week. \"It was a good place to organise. It was physically the right environment, but I think that it's true that it's now become lumbered with a good deal of history and mythology. And I will be quite glad [to move].\"\n",

            "The new headquarters - low-key, low-rise refurbished modern offices in Old Queen Street in the heart of Westminster - will, says Triesman, \"symbolise a new openness\". The building will be nameless, working through the night, yes, yet spinning a little more gently, a little less shrilly than its over-spun and myth-engulfed predecessor. As for Millbank itself, the traffic fumes and the breeze along the Thames will still be there. So, too, the mysterious organisations that toil and spin in the stainless-steel tower. But, of the early days of New Labour, not a trace. Not so much as the electronic squeak of a pager on the belt of a tagged and gagged member of parliament.\n",

And will yet another quartet of artists set themselves up, or will they run and hide, joining the throng of contenders who turn down the chance to be parodied, mocked and misrepresented? The Turner Prize is a big deal in Britain, but winning it has less impact on an artist's career than might be supposed. For Tyson, the inclusion of his work in the international section of the last Venice Biennale was surely more significant than last night's award. Only the money counts. With every year, the prize becomes more meaningless. Art is not like novel writing here, not everyone is speaking the same language. For all that, Tyson's work can be appreciated on many levels: it is often funny and calls up big issues. It manages, paradoxically, to be highly accessible yet incomprehensible: why is that toaster under the table, and why is it plugged in to the exploded rear end of a Trafalgar Square lion? Maybe the prize is a bribe, so Tyson will tell.Such obscure motives are part of his play with meaning. Tyson's art, clearly, beguiles people.\n",

            "artcle: 48 Is it any wonder actresses are neurotic about their appearance? If anyone ever doubted the sexist scrutiny they are up against, Michael Parkinson's 1975 interview with Helen Mirren (a YouTube sensation) is a sobering reminder. \"Critics spend as much time discussing her physical attributes as assessing her acting ability,\" says Parky, by way of introduction for the \"sex queen\" of the RSC, that byword for \"sluttish eroticism\". Nor does he seem much interested in Mirren's acting, either. \"You are, in quotes, a 'serious actress'; do you find what might best be described as your equipment hinders you in that pursuit?\"\n",

            "You can understand why many women on stage and screen prefer the title \"actor\" – as an assertion of their professionalism and to fend off the prurient personal remarks the \"actress\" has suffered since she first trod the boards in the 1660s.\n",
            "\n",
            "The emergence of the actress on the Restoration stage was revolutionary. As every pupil of Shakespeare knows, it was men in drag who took the ladies' parts before. Imagine the frisson, then, when Nell Gwyn first showed herself aged 14 to a packed house at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in 1664. This unprecedented female exhibition provoked salacious frenzy, which theatre companies hoped to harness to their profit.\n",
            "\n",
            "The showcasing of beauties in \"breeches roles\" exploded ideas of decorum. Actresses welcomed the chance to demonstrate the virtuosity demanded by parts such as Viola and Rosalind. But the display of their shapely legs was condemned as an exercise in \"brazenness\" which confirmed the shameless immodesty and sexual availability of the actress. That both theatre-land and prostitution had their metropolis in Covent Garden was not lost on the press. From the first, the \"actress\" of popular imagination was a shimmering mixture of whore, coquette, talent and celebrity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nell Gwyn, still one of history's most famous Englishwomen, might justly claim to be the original female celebrity. Born in obscurity, barely literate and no conventional beauty (red headed and hazel eyed), Gwyn was as celebrated for her ready wit as her legs – which she revealed even when cast as an angel in The Virgin Mary. Within months of her debut, Nell was known to the public by her first name. In becoming mistress to Charles II, but never hoity toity, she became the people's Cinderella, and a Protestant one at that. \"Nell\" was both star and brand.\n",
            "\n",
            "A new exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, The First Actresses: Nell Gwyn to Sarah Siddons, investigates the concept of the \"actress\" in all its troubling contradictions. The artists include Reynolds, Gainsborough, Hoppner, Lawrence, Zoffany and Gillray.\n",
            "\n",
            "The exhibition is the brainchild of Gill Perry. When she was writing her book Spectacular Flirtations: Viewing the Actress in Eighteenth Century Art and Culture, she realised that the NPG had an exceptional collection of early actress portraits – \"And not only that they are in Covent Garden,\" she says.\n",
            "\n",
            "The idea appealed to Lucy Peltz, the NPG's curator of 18th-century portraits, because this \"will be the first show to explore the importance of women in early English theatre, through portraiture, highlighting themes that are close to the Gallery's heart – gender, identity, representation and the history of celebrity culture.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The first actresses benefited from an emerging publicity machine that anticipated aspects of the modern star system. The explosion of print after the relaxation of censorship in the 1690s spawned theatre reviews, gossip columns and puffs, as well as adoring and salacious biographies. The burgeoning art market served their image too. Fans could gaze on their idols in glowing portraits in popular exhibitions and mass-produced prints. They could even take home a model of their favourite in porcelain (Kitty Clive as Mrs Riot or Sarah Siddons as Lady Macbeth) or a transfer printed on snuffbox, fan or screen.\n",
            "\n",
            "Portraits of actresses were always crowd-pleasers at the Royal Academy, hanging next to the flower of the nobility – a juxtaposition that inflated the prestige of the performing arts. The actress was usually depicted in full theatrical make-up and flamboyant costume, posed seductively to beguile the viewer. \"Portraiture is always a form of dazzling performance, not a mirror image,\" Perry points out. But the audience conflated the painted lady with the real woman, and the actress with her role.\n",
            "\n",
            "The canniest performers stage-managed their public appearances to enhance their reputations. Mary \"Perdita\" Robinson used her well-reported outings in \"her chariot\" to advertise her versatility. As Laetitia Hawkins wrote in her diary: \"Today she was a paysanne, with her straw hat tied at the back of her head … yesterday she perhaps had been dressed as a belle of Hyde Park, trimmed, powdered, patched, painted to the utmost powder of rouge and white lead; tomorrow she would be the cravatted Amazon of the riding house.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Artists, critics and dramatists were as interested in the public persona and desirability of the actress as in her acting. Even singing and dancing were described as theatrical flirtation and coquetry. But women were not passive victims of the new cultural marketplace. They constituted an opinionated section of the audience for plays, as for opera, concerts, assemblies and exhibitions. Meanwhile the first female journalists, novelists and playwrights managed to live by their pens. Many actresses including Susanne Centlivre, Charlotte Charke, Kitty Clive, Eliza Haywood, Elizabeth Inchbald, Susanna Rowson, Siddons and Robinson enjoyed a second career as playwrights and authors, some deliberately writing challenging roles for women.\n",
            "\n",
            "Others like Lavinia Fenton, Elizabeth Farren, Frances Abington and Dorothy Jordan used their charisma to scale the social ladder. Their leap \"from gutter to royal mistress or aristocratic wife might surprise the Hello! generation\", Peltz says.\n",
            "\n",
            "The skill with which actresses managed and manipulated their public reputations is striking. Clive, for instance, was a separated wife, who shone in breeches parts, comedy and oratorio, attracting numerous admirers. By 1744, she enjoyed a salary of £300 a year – twice the annual income of the director of the British Museum. She shrewdly maintained a reputation for chastity. At her death, Horace Walpole sniffed: \"The comic muse with her retired. And shed a tear when she expired.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Critics lingered over Siddons's perfection of form. \"Her height is above the middle size, but not at all inclined to em-bon-point. There is sufficient muscle to bestow a roundness upon the limbs. The symmetry of her person is exact and captivating.\" But Siddons conveyed the impression she was above such tosh. She harped on her love for her children and vaunted her aristocratic contacts, carrying herself with regal dignity. This air of moral rectitude and personal nobility leant credence to her tragic performances and informed the grandiloquence of her portrait by Reynolds.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, as Perry acknowledges, the \"construction of the actress as a celebrity brand was a fickle process\". A reputation could be as easily demolished as made in print, especially by dredging up a scurrilous sexual history. Being a lofty vehicle of erotic fantasy was one thing, a whorish backstory was quite another. No wonder so many actresses turned to autobiography or commissioned self-portraits to frame their own story. \"Artists – even in satirical prints – paid less notice to the breasts of actresses than critics did,\" comments Shearer West in her essay on beauty in the catalogue. Jordan's \"bosom concealed everything but its own charms\", frothed one reviewer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Commentary on the appearance of actresses was not always positive. Beautiful females were supposed to be symmetrical, irrespective of the demands of the role, and performers could be castigated for being either to fat or too thin. Farren, a comedienne, was mocked for her flat chest and bottom. Most actresses had no choice but to soldier on through heavy pregnancy and inevitably feared for their livelihood when they could no longer convince as pert ingénues. When Garrick was urged to restage The Jealous Wife for Hannah Pritchard (then aged 57) he recoiled at her \"great Bubbies, Nodding head & no teeth – O Sick – Sick – Spew\".\n",
            "\n",
            "When modern critics rate a female performance on whether it's theatrical Viagra or doubt that a woman is thin enough to play Juliet, they invoke a long and dishonourable tradition. \"Modern actors should see the first actresses as trailblazers, fighting prejudice and innuendo,\" Perry concludes. Certainly women today might take comfort that so many of their forebears managed to seize the public relations initiative and shape the culture that so objectified them.\n",

Innocent things: a toilet roll dangling in cool morning light, an acrobat diving, stags at bay. And guilty things: two women doing something with a cucumber, a man doing something to another woman with a length of pipe, a woman sucking a man's penis, a Nazi hanging a boy who has something almost like a smile on his face. Humiliated Jews, the camps. Emaciated victims in the hut, touched up with vivid happy colours. Photos of trains going by near the artist's studio in Cologne. Is it now possible, in Europe, to watch trains without thinking where the lines once led? Is it possible to look at so many images - whether mundane, or titillating and pornographic, or inhuman and horrific and filled with despair - without becoming aware of just how much we like to look, that looking drives us where it will, that we keep on looking?\n",
            "\n",
            "Atlas is an ever-growing bank of images, encyclopedic, compendious. Many of the photographs were taken by Richter himself, while others are re-photographed images whose origins slip away the more they have been reproduced. Arrays of standard processed snapshots - ordinary, inartistic photographic information that could have come from anywhere - have found their way into this vast cache, including close-up details of the artist's own brushwork and pictures of his children and grandchildren. The anonymous and universal vie with the personal and sentimental. Most images that have found a place here never migrate beyond it. Stalled images, then: some suspended in groups and others lain out singly, all behind glass in identically sized frames, then ordered and presented in juxtapositions that, the artist has remarked, are sometimes \"weird and seemingly cynical\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Some groups contain material collected as a resource for specific paintings. At one point Richter, obsessed with Caspar David Friedrich's painting of a ship mired in a frozen sea, travelled to the pack ice and icebergs off Greenland and took numerous photographs there. These colour works are now presented in a huge block of images that fills a wall of the smaller upstairs gallery at the Whitechapel. Other groups stand out, such as the magazine photographs and police archive documentation related to the lives, imprisonment and mysterious deaths of the Red Army Faction in jail, for Richter's most important ensemble of works, titled October 18 1977. Certain images erupt from the wall as we scan. There are stories here, chains of coincidence, runs of images like repetitive thoughts that won't go away.\n",
            "\n",
            "Atlas has been presented in exhibitions around the world since 1972, although Richter began to compile and order his stockpile a decade before, soon after his move to the west when he was 30. He has continued to add to his Atlas to this day. It has been in a work in progress for more than 40 years, its origins lying not so much in his art as in a job he once had as a darkroom assistant to a commercial photographer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Richter is one of the world's leading painters, if not the most impressive painter working today. He is also a somewhat bewildering artist, in that his work ranges from portraiture to thickly worked, agglutinative abstract paintings, from intractable monochromes to softly focused, photographically derived landscapes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Always preoccupied with questions of subject matter, and of manner and genre, Richter has continually asked himself the most basic and fundamental questions an artist, working alone in his studio, can ask: questions of what to paint as much as how to paint. These, one might say, are the first things an artist might ask right at the beginning of a career. They are the questions a child often asks: what shall I paint, what shall I draw? That the artist, now in his 70s, is still faced with what I regard as an existential as well as a creative problem is one of the keys to his art, as well as being its submerged subject.\n",
            "\n",
            "Born in Dresden in 1932, Richter moved to West Germany only months before the erection of the Berlin Wall. His formative years were spent under not one but two totalitarian regimes, National Socialism and East German communism. He came from what he has described as a pious family. Moving to Düsseldorf in 1961, he found himself in a Germany preoccupied with forgetting, or, perhaps more precisely, repressing its own recent past, suspended in a state of moral ambiguity. All of which has led Richter to distrust ideologies, and to make an art that is the product of doubt and ambiguity - that also defines what artistic freedom he sees himself as having. It is worth adding that Richter's art is extraordinarily tough-minded.\n",
            "\n",
            "What Atlas shows us, cumulatively, is an entire world of images, some of which Richter regards as unpaintable. A dozen years ago, Neil Ascherson wrote: \"Richter's sensibility, although it is in many ways carefully unpolitical, is a product of this endlessly idealistic, endlessly disillusioned Germany.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The key word is Ascherson's repeated \"endlessly\". Images, too, are without end. Walking among the banked grids of Atlas, one has a growing sense of their proliferation, of Richter's logic and also of the randomness and multiplicity of the world, its intractability. But there is also a growing sense of Richter brooding, brooding over the images that have made their way into Atlas. It is a dark undercurrent in his art. Richter's fellow East German and contemporary, Sigmar Polke, seems to me to evince the opposite in his art, a kind of hysteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ascherson also wrote of what some people saw as Richter's inner coldness and indifference. For all the hot colour in certain Richters - his sunny landscapes, his broken-textured, scraped-over abstract paintings, his colour charts - there is something one might describe as a chill, an inner greyness. And, ultimately, Atlas might seem to be a product of indifference. Or is it that photographs themselves provoke indifference?\n",
            "\n",
            "What appears as Richter's distance - a wariness and inconclusiveness, a blurring and shadowiness in his portraiture, his cityscapes and still lives - can also be read as a kind of terrible doubt, which goes beyond painting itself, and beyond his painting's frequently close relationship to photography.\n",
            "\n",
            "Richter once said: \"The image of the artist as a misunderstood figure is abhorrent to me... I'm increasingly in favour of the official, the classic, the universal.\" This I take as a kind of provocation. To those who cling, however naively, blindly or idealistically, to an idea of an avant-garde pitched against the \"official\" and the \"classic\", this is anathema. In some quarters Richter has come to be regarded as a pompier painter, a bourgeois salon painter for the kind of society that a more \"committed\" art should be pitted against. But Richter has always been too complex a painter, and a thinker, to fit so simplistic a view.\n",
            "\n",
            "What Atlas shows us (and what his greatest work, the Baader-Meinhof October 18 paintings, also shows us) is an artist committed not to his own aggrandisement or to bolstering society, but pitted, rather, against indifference, and against the numbness of the world. He is also, in a certain way, fiercely mistrustful of images and what they convey. Some photographs, especially those of the Holocaust, are irreducible, and perhaps unpaintable in themselves. He keeps picking them up and putting them down again. You can tell he is in there, thinking them through and unable to think about them. When we look at them, we do the same. And do our own brooding.\n",

Were businesses simply to reinvest cash flow at historic rates, fixed investment would add nearly 4% to GDP ($695 billion) by the end of 2016 and more than offset the fiscal drag from reduced disposable personal income.”\n",

            "artcle: 53 Coco Chanel, asked to explain the difference between fashion and art, elegantly replied that 'art appreciates in interest and value over time, fashion depreciates.' But art has lately become intensely fashionable. Its current dual status, as sexy but potentially enduring, makes it an immensely valuable tool of communication: cool, but capable of speaking viscerally at deeper levels of meaning. Which is how a group of British artists come to be in Mexico City, putting together a stunning exhibition of installations, video and works on paper.\n",
            "\n",
            "Vast, sprawling and polluted, Mexico is a multi-layered city: ancient, Spanish-colonial, modern. But not, probably, the first place you'd look for a major exhibition of cutting-edge British art. Not where you'd immediately expect to find Martin Boyce from Glasgow, installing his work 'Our Love Is Like the Flowers, the Rain, the Sea and the Hours', with its tree-like structures of fluorescent tubes, screens of metal fencing and shapes recalling half-destroyed park benches, the whole thing reminiscent of a crepuscular public space. Not, either, the first place you'd look for Mark Titchner, the London artist who has explored modernism through wall paintings, banners and billboards.\n",
            "\n",
            "But that would be to reckon without the British Council, which celebrates its 70th anniversary this week, and which has been quietly amassing an impressive collection of modern art for all of that time and showing it around the world. The British Council has sponsored Boyce, Titchner and other British artists to come to the teeming, steaming cacophony of Mexico City. What they achieve here, politically, will not be easily measured: art can only offer a subtle, slow-burn sort of diplomacy. It may be very valuable; we'll almost certainly never know.\n",
            "\n",
            "The British Council's job is to sell Britain around the world by way of culture. This can be an uphill struggle. Recent research by the Council in China, for example, found that among people aged between 25 and 34 who were well educated and had high incomes, only five per cent thought of Britain as a modern country. A British diplomat in Mexico told me that when Mexicans think of Britain, they typically think of beefeaters. As a result, British public diplomacy there is geared to getting across two messages: Britain is hi-tech; and Britain is a modern country.\n",
            "\n",
            "Art may be useful here: no one could argue that British art is not vibrant, intellectually engaged and global in its outlook and ambitions. At the same time, you can't go around telling people what they should find interesting about you. When, three years ago, the British Council approached the Tamayo Museum in Mexico City proposing an exhibition of our art, it was with the idea of sending a major Gilbert and George retrospective. But the Tamayo's director, Ramiro Martinez, didn't want Gilbert and George and he didn't want the YBAs. He wanted to know what was happening in Britain now, and he wanted his museum to be involved in deciding what about that was relevant to Mexico.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a result, the artists who are here installing their works for the opening were jointly selected by Tobias Ostrander, a US-born specialist in Latin American art who works at the Tamayo, and a curator from the British Council, Ann Gallagher. The show they have come up with is not intended to be a summation of where British art is now, even if such a thing were possible; 'rather,' according to Ostrander, 'it's a themed show with British artists.'\n",
            "\n",
            "The theme is the city. Mexico is the biggest city in the world (depending how you measure it) and one of the most dangerous (locals told me the only place riskier was Bogotá). Some of its inhabitants are off-the-scale rich: Mexicans would be well represented in a list of the wealthiest people in the world. Prices are as high as in London.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the same time, it is also extremely poor. This is the capital of a country whose second-largest source of GDP, after oil, is receipts from nationals working abroad, mainly in low-grade jobs in California.\n",
            "\n",
            "Vast areas of the city are dirt-poor. The infrastructure seems unable to take the strain: visitors are advised not to take taxis because the drivers may be in league with kidnappers. Mexico is a thick soup of cultures, often highly sophisticated; 'a city that's exotic for foreigners, where people are acutely aware of its foreignness,' as Martinez says. But it is also a city that provokes passionate attachment: 'People defend their belonging to the city, in a way like they do in New York.'\n",
            "\n",
            "So the artists selected from Britain, with their works on paper, videos and installations, all have something to say about this - about the sensory experience of the city, its smells, noises, and textures, about our relationship with its modernist ambitions and motifs, and about the emotions engendered by living with its artificiality and gritty realities. The show is to be called Sodium and Asphalt, words that, helpfully, are almost identical in English and Spanish.\n",
            "\n",
            "Twelve British artists are showing, although Oliver Payne and Nick Relph, who work together, should perhaps count as one. Six are in Mexico for the opening (David Batchelor, Kathrin Böhm, Martin Boyce, Rosalind Nashashibi, Melanie Smith and Mark Titchner); Jim Lambie and his technician have been and gone. Others will come in a few months, when the show moves north, to Monterrey.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tobias Ostrander visited Britain twice, seeing the studios and galleries of artists who interested him, concentrating in the end on London and Glasgow (the Glaswegian art scene is particularly vital at present; four of the selected artists were from the city).\n",
            "\n",
            "Before starting on the project, he knew the work only of a handful of the artists. 'I knew Richard Wright's work, so when I went to Glasgow I made sure I saw him. I'd seen Jim Lambie's work in New York, and also David Batchelor's; I also knew of David Batchelor as an important writer and teacher.' (Batchelor is the author of an influential, and in this context highly relevant, book about colour, Chromophobia.)\n",
            "\n",
            "'In Glasgow we saw Rosalind Nashashibi's video, \"The State of Things\",' Ostrander says. The video features women sorting through old clothes at a jumble sale, and is lingeringly, almost languorously shot. 'We were both drawn to it. That ended up influencing considerably how we thought about the textures of the city - its recycled materials, trash, its slowness.'\n",
            "\n",
            "Ann Gallagher paid reciprocal visits to Mexico City to explore the preoccupations of local artists and identify points of contact. She and Ostrander were in email contact for months, exchanging images and ideas.\n",

            "'Although this is a show about British artists,' Ostrander says, 'it also questions what it means to be British.' Melanie Smith arrived in Mexico City a decade ago and never left: one local critic told me that as far as the Mexicans were concerned, she was only on loan to Britain for this exhibition. Another of the artists, Kathrin Böhm, is German by birth, although she did postgraduate work at Goldsmiths, lives in Hackney and has an office/studio in Camden. Rosalind Nashashibi, who is based in Glasgow, is half-Palestinian. Nick Relph and Oliver Payne do much of their work in New York.\n",

            "In Albion, one of the best of the small landfill of books and academic papers that has been produced in the last 20 years agonising over what Britain stands for in a globalised, post-Cold War world, Peter Ackroyd argues that 'the power of Anglo-Saxon culture springs in part from absorption and assimilation ... it can be maintained that English art and English literature are formed out of inspired adaptation; like the language, and like the inhabitants of the nation itself, they represent the apotheosis of the mixed style.'\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the most appealing things about the British Council's proselytising on behalf of British culture is its inclusiveness about what our culture might be. When I visited the Council's permanent collection, Andrea Rose, head of visual arts, had told me of her department's eagerness to claim Anish Kapoor for Britain. Kapoor, who arrived in Britain from India at the age of 17, represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1990, a move that kick-started his career; he has maintained a warm relationship with the Council ever since, and donated works to the collection.\n",
            "\n",
            "Only a couple of elements in Sodium and Asphalt are from the British Council's permanent collection: a couple of glittery turntables by Jim Lambie, made from his usual recycled, junk-shop materials, alluding to the club scene in Glasgow, where Lambie was a band member and DJ; and a work on paper by Richard Wright '(not titled 31.3.04)', a faux-wood surface, beautiful in the way of meticulously executed original work, and yet representing something entirely cheap and fake.\n",
            "\n",
            "If Ostrander and Gallagher hadn't wanted so much that was site-specific, they could have put together any number of exhibitions from the permanent collection. The Council mounts an average of 60 shows a year, featuring 4,000 works. A couple of weeks before going out to Mexico, I'd visited the warehouse round the back of a bus garage in Acton, west London, where its store of treasures is housed, to see how the operation works.\n",
            "\n",
            "No sooner was I through the door than I came face to face with a vast yellow and primary-hued piece, 'Diana As An Engine' by Eduardo Paolozzi, which was just back from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tehran and Pakistan. Round the corner I almost tripped over a dizzying Bridget Riley; hanging on the wall beside it was an Antony Gormley sculpture, a huge nude with outstretched arms.\n",

            "It was all very odd: tucked under the Tube line where it peters out into west London was one of the most extraordinary and least-known collections of modern and contemporary art in this country - 8,000 works, representing every significant artist of the past 60 years, from Henry Moore to Damien Hirst, Lucian Freud to Rachel Whiteread, Bridget Riley to Sarah Lucas. The collection is quintessentially British, but only 10 per cent is ever in this country at any one time. Its role is to be out on the road, in Tehran and Turkmenistan, Bangalore and Mumbai, Bogotá and São Paulo.\n",
            "\n",
            "Co-curated exhibitions such as Sodium and Asphalt are not the norm, although increasingly, many shows involve some reciprocal local involvement - so, for example, a design exhibition that has been touring India this year and is due to travel to Australia early in 2005 has acquired a tour 'appendix' from every country or region visited, exploring the exchange of design ideas to and from the host area and other cultures. Featured artists often give lectures and host workshops: Richard Deacon, Bill Woodrow and Anthony Caro all flew out to a show of 20th-century British Sculpture in Iran this spring and met young Iranian artists, while Michel Muller of the Henry Moore Foundation ran a bronze conservation workshop and Tim Marlow, director of White Cube, and Tate Britain's director Stephen Deuchar both gave lectures.\n",
            "\n",
            "The operation is all the more impressive given the limitations of the British Council's budgets: in practice, there is roughly £100,000 a year available (out of a total grant of £2.2m) to buy new work. This requires that the Council buys cleverly, mainly when artists are young and their influence unproven. One reason the acquisitions policy is so successful is that the Council has a very high-powered advisory committee. Currently chaired by the director of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, this includes the directors of the National Gallery, Tate Britain, the V&A, the Whitechapel, the Hayward, the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, the Liverpool Biennial and the Henry Moore Foundation, plus one art critic (Richard Dorment at present) and one artist (currently Richard Wentworth, who also happens to be Master of the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art at Oxford). It meets twice a year, but is feeding through information and insights all the time.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Council doesn't buy speculatively; it acquires works because of their fit for a particular set of projects. Andrea Rose shows me a recent acquisition by Toby Ziegler: a huge, hi-tech piece that's almost mystically reflective. It was purchased with a view to touring the Middle East, currently a high priority, but where figurative work can be seen as anti-Islamic and the sex-and-scatology content of some contemporary art can be a problem. It will form part of a New Abstraction show, for which it may take two years to assemble the right pieces. Obviously it would be easier and cheaper to borrow, and the Council will happily do so. But much of the work sitting in the warehouse on the day that I visit (including a new Damien Hirst, 'Resurrection', featuring a human skeleton) has just come back from Tehran. When the Iran exhibition was first being discussed, so was war in Iraq. The places that the British Council most wants to go are precisely those that the owners of much-loved, fabulously expensive artworks are least likely to want to risk sending them for months on end.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the warehouse, I see the first work the British Council's visual arts department ever acquired: a chocolate-boxy painting of a farmhouse, by Duncan Grant, a bucolic idyll of a certain kind of Britain. This inward-looking nation is not the one that the Council wants to promote any more. Its activities are much better summed up by its decision to send Sam Taylor-Wood to St Petersburg this winter to premiere two new videos; or indeed, by its eagerness to work with a Mexican curator on exploring common preoccupations in Latin American and British urban centres.\n",
            "\n",
            "'The foreign office sets the geopolitical agenda - the mission to younger audiences, East rather than West, the Islamic world and China. Editorially, we are independent,' says Andrea Rose. 'When we went to Iran earlier this year there was a definite sense on the part of people we were meeting and talking to of, \"Why aren't we part of the rest of the world?\" We can use this collection far more subversively than people realise.'\n",
            "\n",
            "In Mexico City, a pollution smog hangs over the city, obscuring the surrounding mountains: the altitude-thin air is thick with fumes and the press of people. It's the day before the opening. But the Tamayo Museum is air-conditioned and peaceful in the way of big, concrete modernist spaces, and the artists are managing to remain fairly calm, despite last-minute hitches. 'There's a very different energy in Britain now from the YBAs,' says Ostrander; 'especially the Glasgow scene: it's much more relaxed. There's far less ego: a really generous attitude.' The artists who have come out for the opening are distinguished by a thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness: one of the strongest themes in the show is a powerful, shared critique of formal abstraction. But they are also friendly, unprecious and easy-going.\n",

Her work is part of an ongoing project called 'and millions and millions', which involves her pasting cut-up pieces of hand-printed and offset posters on the wall in a collage of flat, coloured, geometric shapes, often layered on top of each other. She works slowly, cutting out shapes, tacking them up with tape, on different parts of the wall and even different walls at the same time. The process is hypnotic, and confusing - why has she built up so much over there and nothing over here? It looks as if she will never be ready.\n",

Unfortunately, Mexican customs are holding it to ransom and want $150 for its release. Mark Titchner's giant billboard went up more easily than he expected A maelstrom of colour and patterning, it makes reference to computer punchcards, to the way that utopian and radical ideas are seized by the market, by advertising and hype, and reduced to banal slogans. The effect is compelling, resonant with colour and life. Unfortunately, it is also too long for the wall, which isn't straight. Obviously, he doesn't want to cut the end off, but neither does he want it hanging off the wall.\n",

            "Richard Gough, the technician who is here to oversee the unpacking and installation, takes me out to the back of the museum, where the British Council's trademark powder-blue packing cases are stacked (the Tate uses yellow cases; the National Gallery dark green) and talks about his work with nerdy enthusiasm: 'This case was made for a Rachel Whiteread exhibition seven months ago. It's been to São Paulo and Rio.' Like several of the other British Council technicians, Gough was trained as a fine artist. He has reason to be proud of his packing: Diana Eccles, who is in charge of the collection, told me that nothing had been broken in 70 years of constant shuttling around the globe. The objects and paintings being transported are often terrifyingly valuable, uninsurable other than by government indemnity. 'If we did break something,' says Eccles, 'we'd probably go out of business.'\n",

Swaddled and sealed like this, they are safe from cold, heat, humidity and vibration. They must be unpacked in the presence of someone from the British Council, and the contents and precise disposition of each layer noted, so that they can be packed up again in exactly the same fashion.\n",

            "Eventually, the dimmer switch is released. The gallery's lighting is fine-tuned so that it doesn't bleed into the wrong spaces. Melanie Smith's volume is turned down. The last pictures are secured on the wall and the fixings painted over. (They are lower, Ann Gallagher notes, than in Britain, because people in Mexico are shorter; in Germany pictures are hung higher.) The Tamayo technicians manage to build an extra bit of wall behind Mark Titchner's overhanging billboard. Kathrin Böhm stops, apparently randomly. She puts out posters for people to take, so they can try it at home. The floors are swept for the 20th time, tea lights are placed all round the walls of the foyer. Everything is more or less ready for the opening.\n",

            "The target audience is the usual one for the Tamayo; the director of the British Council in Mexico makes the point that he's not running a development agency, so his target market is not the inhabitants of the city's slums. It's key decision makers, such as the Minister of Culture; then advisers and the press; and thirdly, young people who themselves aspire to be decision makers, and who may also be interested in studying in Britain, since the Prime Minister has pledged himself to increasing the number of foreign students at British universities.\n",

            "Everyone is pleased, because the Minister of Culture turns up, and she doesn't usually bother with openings. A leading Mexican critic talks to me approvingly about bridging the cultures, about pop influences, references to the grid of the city and the poetry of its patterns. The British ambassador tells me that the Mexicans and the British share a sense of humour and predilection for not taking ourselves too seriously. The embassy, she adds, is working with the Mexican government on reform of the civil service and of the judiciary.

The leading critic, Cuauhtemoc Medina, says he's intrigued by the 'rather peculiar, not easily explicable dialogue between Mexico City and London'. (At the time of Sodium and Asphalt, six Mexican artists are exhibiting in different venues in Britain.) This dialogue is curious, he adds, given that Britain wasn't the colonial power, isn't the real power now, and there's no large immigrant population. In common with the British ambassador, he thinks it must have something to do with sensibility, 'with sense of humour and directness'.\n",

Like the World Service, the British Council's visual arts department isn't susceptible to the current obsession with targets, but one senses, nevertheless, that it's an institution about which we can probably allow ourselves to feel proud. The UK - four countries with an uncertain commitment to being a nation - seems particularly troubled by the legacy of its past and its part in the global future. It is a paradox that a nation so uncertain about its place in the modern world does propaganda for its place in the modern world really rather well.\n",

A little warning tone will sound and the app will make note of your carelessness.

These institutions, now national symbols, have presented the story of a nation – in other words, history – as much more important than the stories of individuals. This is unfortunate: the stories of individuals are much better suited to displaying the depths of our humanity.\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "6 It is imperative that museums become smaller, more individualistic, and cheaper. This is the only way that they will ever tell stories on a human scale. Big museums with their wide doors call upon us to forget our humanity and embrace the state and its human masses. This is why millions outside the western world are afraid of going to museums.\n",

Even if that doesn’t happen, JPM’s stock is trading for nine times its last 12 months of profits.

            "The family had already taken over the old bowling green cafe, just up the road, rather than see it close. They never intended a cafe empire, until Murray spotted a planning notice warning that the small snack shack, slap on the edge of the beach, was about to be expanded into a hideous, large redbrick cafe. So they bought it. The extraordinary design arose from a conversation between Wood and Heatherwick, both guests at the birthday party of arts entrepreneur Wilfred Cass at his sculpture park just inland from the town.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"There's that awful cliche of the seaside cafe, looking like a New England cabin, all blue and white with little porthole windows,\" Thomas Heatherwick said. \"I wanted mine to look like something you might find washed up on the beach in all the tangles of flotsam and jetsam as you walk along the tide line.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "As the building, constructed by a local welding firm, began to go up, Wood and Murray posted a series of long chatty letters to the town on the wire security fence, explaining exactly what was happening.

Meanwhile Wood admitted, slightly embarrassed, that she'd seen another planning notice, warning that another nearby cafe was also about to be torn down and replaced with something bigger and uglier - so she's just bought that too. \"It would have been slap in the view from this wonderful building, what else could I do?\" she explained.\n",

            "\n",
            "Among the 18 works there are three by Lucian Freud, including a tiny louche portrait of a young man with a cigarette drooping from his lips, and three characteristically creepy paintings by Balthus. Other highlights include Pierre Bonnard's painting of his wife's slender legs stretched out in her bath - an image that became the catalogue cover of the recent retrospective; the sunset water lilies which Monet asked to keep even after he sold the picture so he could study it as he recovered from eye surgery; one of Francis Bacon's disturbing studies of shrieking male heads contorted by rage or terror; and Gauguin's homage to Cezanne's still lives of apples. There is also a delightful, very early Gainsborough, as compositionally incompetent as it is charming, of Mr and Mrs Carter. This couple may be the parents of the woman in the artist's Mr and Mrs Andrews, one of the best loved paintings in the National Gallery collection.\n",

            "\n",
            "So the National gets one of the most endearing pictures, the 1909 portrait of the art dealer Joseph Brummer by Henri Rousseau - a picture in which the self-taught Rousseau saw himself as continuing the loftiest tradition of academic portraits - because it already owns the children's favourite, Rousseau's Tiger In a Tropical Storm (Surprised!).\n",

            "The Fondazione Prada, at the Ca' Corner della Regina palace on the Grand Canal, has done more than revisit the 1969 exhibition in Venice this week. The Italian curator Germano Celant, the original impresario of arte povera and a friend of the late Szeemann (the two discovered they were interested in the same artists, and shared their address books when Szeemann was working on the show) has restaged the entire exhibition as closely as possible, gathering the same works, installing them in rooms that resemble, as closely as can be devised, those at the Bern Kunsthalle in 1969. To achieve this, Celant has worked with architect Rem Koolhaas and German artist Thomas Demand, who is best known for his paper models of actual places – from Saddam's bolthole to the destroyed room where a failed assassination attempt was made on Hitler's life – which Demand then photographs to produce his art.\n",

            "Reconstructing and reconfiguring walls and floors, and even including the intrusive radiators and fittings of a late 1960s Swiss kunsthalle inside a Venetian palace, cannot be achieved seamlessly. The resemblances achieve a strange yet magical dislocated double-take. There is a weird feeling of time-slip and dislocation. As far as possible, the same works have been brought together as they were 44 years ago. Where works are missing, drawn outlines on the walls and floors indicate where they once would have been. Like the outlines of bodies at a crime scene, the lines indicate not just lost objects, but lost time. These absences touch my heart – even if, in this cynical age, we might pretend art no longer has the power to move us. Perhaps it is a loss of innocence, most of all, that the current exhibition commemorates.\n",

Works by different artists are placed cheek-by-jowl, often crammed into the galleries. One of Richard Artschwager's small \"blips\" – little black shapes he used to interrupt the exhibition space – is actually on the wall behind one of Richard Serra's leaning steel plates. Other works sneak around each other, approach one another warily and fall into casual conversation. There was little of the one-upmanship and flagrant space-hogging we see nowadays. There is a feeling that all the artists in When Attitudes Become Form were in it together, whatever it was.\n",

            "Focus. “We rebuilt that first T-shirt time and time again during the first five years,” Plank said about Under Armour’s early product development. “People kept saying, ‘You should do this…You should do that,’” he recalled, noting that he ignored advice to broaden his product line. Two decades later, Under Armour sells shoes and sunglasses and all sorts of athletic gear, but the original product, the moisture-wicking T-shirt, is still in development. “I think we’re on the 63rd version of that shirt,” Plank said as we chatted after his keynote. “It’s key to become ‘famous’ for one thing first,” he added, “and that will give you the credibility to go into other areas once your ready….which generally means a long time and a lot of perfecting!”\n",
            "\n",
            "Find out if your product can sell. Before he created Under Armour, Plank had an on-campus rose-selling business, Cupid’s Valentine. He invested $16,000 from that business into his T-shirt startup in 1996—and $9,000 of the $16,000 went into patents and trademarks. “Save yourself time and money,” Plank said, contending that he overspent on legal fees. Early on, use scarce capital to “get your product into stores,” he advised.\n",
            "\n",
            "Possess strong will. “I have a saying at the company,” Plank said as he described how he talks to his 7,000 employees’ about their Baltimore-based company’s culture of ownership. “Employees get things done. Partners get things done done. But owners get things done done done.”\n",

            "Act One We start with something I learned from tax expert Edward Kleinbard, a University of Southern California law school professor and a prolific, witty, and effective polemicist whose new book, We Are Better than This: How Government Should Spend Our Money, is a must-read for anyone who wants to be educated about taxes and social policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kleinbard told me something that I should have known but didn’t: American companies are required to pay U.S. income tax on interest and dividends earned on their offshore cash, regardless of whether that income is repatriated to the U.S. (For details, ask a tax techie about Subpart F.) That’s something that very few people know, but it’s really important for our analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "Act Two Last April, S&P issued a nifty report showing how some big U.S. companies are indirectly using their offshore cash to facilitate cheap borrowing in the U.S. That’s the practice that S&P dubs, quite cleverly, “synthetic cash repatriation.” In case you’re interested—and you should be—offshore cash is 60% of the total cash that S&P-rated companies had on their books as of June 30, up from 44% at year-end 2009.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let’s combine Acts One and Two. Because the income earned on firms’ offshore cash is taxable in the U.S., there’s no penalty for repatriating that income into our country. So a company with offshore cash can borrow in the U.S. and use the income earned on its offshore money to pay some or all of the (tax-deductible) interest that it incurs on its U.S. borrowing.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the interest rates at which a company invests its surplus cash offshore and borrows in the U.S. for projects here were identical, the offshore interest income would totally offset the U.S. interest expense. But in the real world, the money a company would borrow to fund a productive, job-creating project would typically have a longer maturity than the short-term securities in which firms generally stash their offshore cash. Therefore, money borrowed in the U.S. to fund a project here would carry a higher interest rate than what the offshore cash earns.\n",
            "\n",
            "So let’s say a company is earning 1% on its offshore cash and pays 3% to borrow here. After taxes—remember, interest paid in the U.S. is deductible to the borrower—that 2% spread costs the company only 1.3%.\n",
            "\n",
            "Act Three The grand finale: A big company that wants to make a capital investment in the U.S. typically has a “hurdle rate”—a minimum return that it expects to earn on that investment—of at least 10% after taxes.\n",
            "\n",
            "If an investment isn’t likely to earn at least the hurdle rate return, the company probably won’t make it, regardless of where the cash to pay for it comes from. If the projected profit exceeds the hurdle rate, the company will make the investment. Shelling out 1.3% after tax to finance an investment expected to earn double digits after tax is a no-brainer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Using offshore cash to borrow cheaply in the U.S. strikes me as a better long-term deal for shareholders than having a company shell out big money to buy an inversion partner, and then having to make that corporate marriage work. (The acquisition has to be sizable, relative to the inverter’s stock market value, for the deal to qualify for inversion treatment under the tax code.)\n",
            "\n",
            "There’s no question that a 1.3% annual cost makes “financial engineering” maneuvers, such as using U.S. borrowings to pay dividends and buy back shares, less lucrative for shareholders than they would otherwise be. However, as we’ve seen, if a company wants to use synthetically repatriated cash to expand and grow, that 1.3% isn’t a big deal.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Harbaugh said the hulking McDonald, 6-foot-4 and 267 pounds, evoked memories of his former coach with the Bears, Mike Ditka, who became the first tight end inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1988.\n",
            "\n",
            "“He reminds me of what I saw of Mike Ditka when he played the game,” Harbaugh said then. “I’m curious to see if Mike Ditka will see the same similarities. That was an exciting thing to get Vance on the team. I kind of wanted to get him No. 89 and it worked out. … I’ll let you guys be the judge — and Coach Ditka — to see if there’s some similarities there.”\n",
            "\n",
            "One and a half seasons into McDonald’s career, one would have to look extremely hard to uncover similarities. McDonald is still sporting Ditka’s jersey number, but his other numbers don’t suggest a Hall of Fame clone: In 20 games, McDonald has 10 catches, 149 receiving yards, four drops and a lost fumble.\n",
            "\n",
            "On Monday, he acknowledged that Harbaugh’s sky-high praise could have been a bit of a burden as a rookie.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I haven’t actually thought about it since last year, and I think that’s a good thing,” McDonald said. “It’s an unbelievable honor to be placed in that company as soon as you come in. But as far as having that in the back of your mind just kind of stalking you, I think that could just be a distraction.”\n",
            "\n",
            "McDonald arrived in the NFL known as a pass-catcher with scant blocking experience. He routinely split out wide in college and finished his career ranked sixth in school history in catches (119), seventh in receiving yards (1,504) and fifth in touchdown catches (15).\n",
            "\n",
            "With the 49ers, however, McDonald has earned high marks for his steadily improving blocking, but has been just a rumor in the passing game. Of the 12 tight ends selected among the first 201 picks in 2013, McDonald, the fourth picked, is the only one without a touchdown catch and is one of two with fewer than 11 career catches.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even Seattle’s Luke Willson, a 2013 fifth-round pick who was in McDonald’s shadow at Rice, has outperformed his ex-teammate. Willson has 27 career catches for 335 yards and two touchdowns.\n",
            "\n",
            "In fairness to McDonald, the man he replaced, Delanie Walker, didn’t put up huge numbers as the No. 2 tight end in an offense featuring Vernon Davis. Walker had 21 catches for 344 yards in 2012 before he signed with the Titans.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It’s different, for sure,” McDonald said. “In college, you have plays drawn up for you. And I’m not in that situation anymore; I’m in this situation. It’s just how you approach it. The good thing is, just the way I was raised by my parents, they instilled in me to take advantage of whatever situation you’re in. No moping. No negative about it.”\n",
            "\n",
            "However, McDonald admitted it’s been a challenge to stay positive when he’s failed to take advantage of an opportunity. A prime example came in a win at St. Louis on Oct. 13 when he lost a fumble at the end of a 21-yard catch, one of his two receptions this season.\n",
            "\n",
            "“I’ve always been extremely hard on myself after something bad happens,” McDonald said. “Focusing on moving past something and not having any negative thoughts in your mind — I think that’s key for anyone’s success. And all the outside noise — whether it’s flak or positive talk — just completely eliminating that and focusing on what I need to do.”\n",
            "\n",
            "McDonald is aware that some impatient fans already view him as a botched draft pick, but he said he focuses on feedback from his teammates and coaches. On Monday, Harbaugh praised McDonald’s blocking and offered an overall favorable assessment.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We’d like to get him the ball more,” Harbaugh said. “But I feel good about Vance.”\n",

            "artcle: 82 For over 20 years, sports fans have turned to the same place for news and highlights nightly at 11 p.m.: ESPN’s “SportsCenter.” From the golden era of Keith Olbermann and Dan Patrick forward, “SportsCenter” has been the gold standard of sports-roundup shows, even as its increasing emphasis on flashy graphics and faux spectacle has eroded a good deal of its watchability. The stage had been set for a genuine rival to the dominance of “SportsCenter.” Enter “Fox Sports Live,” the flagship show of the retooled Fox Sports 1, newly redesignated as a national channel.\n",
            "\n",
            "If ESPN is the CNN of sports news, Fox Sports 1, which premiered in August, intends to be its Fox News — the brash, opinionated competitor that leaves its stodgy competitor in the dust. Visually, “Fox Sports Live” looks much like Fox News. The screen is framed by the ubiquitous breaking-news crawl at the bottom and a list of upcoming topics along its right edge. The framing makes the main event feel unnecessarily cramped, and the blue-yellow-red color scheme is garish. Fox has been successful before with this brutalist look; regardless of one’s political outlook, it can be safely agreed that Fox News is one of the more visually unappetizing channels on cable. “Fox Sports Live” is similarly unpleasant to look at, like a primary-color oil spill seeping in from the edges of the screen.\n",
            "\n",
            "More crucially, “Fox Sports Live” looks to blur the distinction between news and opinion: We report, we decide. “Fox Sports Live” is a mash-up of classic 1990s “SportsCenter,” with imported Canadian hosts Jay Onrait and Dan O’Toole filling the Olbermann-Patrick roles, and an ESPN sports-talk show like “Around the Horn.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Onrait and O’Toole, who made names for themselves as hosts of TSN’s “SportsCentre,” are affable and clownish. For their American sojourn, they have packed suitcases full of shtick, like Onrait’s “You’re off the case, Bobrovsky!” whenever highlights feature Columbus Blue Jackets goalie Sergei Bobrovsky — likely a less common occurrence here than it had been in Canada. But Onrait and O’Toole control only a modest amount of real estate on the show, which also features Charissa Thompson and a slew of former athletes and moderators in an ever-changing array of formats. “Fox Sports Live” thinks that the solution to the monotony of two hosts sitting at one desk is to have 10 hosts at eight different desks, roundtables, and conversation pits.\n",
            "\n",
            "The result is a strange hybrid of news and opinion, in which the traditional highlight segments that make up a sports-news roundup are regularly interrupted by a variety of panels with names like “Let It Ride,” “Whip Around,” and “#failfriday.” Ex-athletes like Gary Payton, Donovan McNabb, and Ephraim Salaam are present to debate the issues of the day: Does Wichita State deserve to be #1? Is Johnny Manziel too short to be an NFL quarterback? Opinion is king, with former Eagles quarterback McNabb directly addressing the camera to call for the resignation of embattled Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intriguingly, “FSL” does not segregate its commentators by sport, giving us the unique pleasure of hearing McNabb discussing the intricacies of mid-major conference play in college basketball. “FSL” is attempting to re-create the good-natured jabbing of “Pardon the Interruption,” but none of the athletes are quite comfortable enough on air. One segment, starting a split second too early, caught former NBA superstar Payton yawning broadly before immediately feigning enthusiasm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps the most Fox News-esque feature of “Fox Sports Live” is the regular presence of Republican pollster (and Fox News analyst) Frank Luntz — pardon me, Dr. Frank Luntz — conducting a live poll of 24 “average fans” on hot-button sports issues like openly gay NFL prospect Michael Sam, or the Petty family’s sexist jeers about NASCAR driver Danica Patrick. Luntz tones down the culture-warrior shtick for this gig, but his segment “Sound Off” still feels like it pits its natural constituency of white, middle-class, vaguely angry guys against a bunch of female and minority softies. Of course, no one is opposed to Sam’s homosexuality here, only the ensuing “media circus.”\n",
            "\n",
            "“Fox Sports Live” also recalibrates the mix of sports coverage, unsurprisingly emphasizing less traditional sports like NASCAR and UFC to which Fox owns the rights. ESPN has always done the same, hyping and downplaying sports relative to the size of their television packages. (When was the last time you saw an extended hockey segment on “SportsCenter”?) Sitting through a 10-minute segment in which Thompson moderated a prefight trash-talk session between UFC fighters Patrick Cummins and Daniel Cormier gave this lifelong sports fan a sense of what it might feel like for a non-sports fan to watch ESPN: Who are these guys? What are they talking about? And why does anyone care?\n",
            "\n",
            "Onrait and O’Toole spent the last two weeks providing goofy, mostly unnecessary standup reporting from the Winter Olympics in Sochi. One segment on pin collecting suggested that the hobby was “a little like life: mildly depressing, with moments of real joy.” The same could be said of “Fox Sports Live,” which is often amusing, but feels strained because of its efforts to differentiate itself from its elder and superior, “SportsCenter.” With its dramatization of angry tweets by Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin and its fake-infomercial vibe for an NBA trade deadline roundup, “Fox Sports Live” has a much-appreciated sense of humor, but could afford to be a bit less overplanned. ESPN has opened the door to competitors through its sheer dominance. “Fox Sports Live,” for all its hard work, does not go nearly far enough in separating itself from the pack.\n",

Everything is here.” That’s just one of the many things you can learn about India in Aditi Brennan Kapil’s “The Displaced Hindu Gods Trilogy,” which Company One Theatre is presenting at the Boston Center for the Arts. The gods in question are the trinity of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Shiva the Destroyer. In Kapil’s three plays they’re displaced to America and turn into women — or at least, 2 1/2 of them do. And though they can’t stop time, they do make it run enjoyably.\n",
            "\n",
            "Kapil herself knows all about displaced. Her father was born in Punjab, in the north of India; he moved to Delhi to become a poet, and then to Communist Bulgaria, where he met her mother. Kapil was born in Sofia, but then the family moved to Stockholm, and eventually she came to the United States to attend college in Minnesota. She still lives there.\n",
            "\n",
            "Company One knows something about Kapil: It staged her “Love Person” back in 2012. Now it’s just the second troupe to offer the complete “Displaced Hindu Gods.” Each play runs between 90 and 100 minutes, with no intermission; each is self-contained, so it doesn’t matter in what order you see them. Company One is presenting “Brahman/i: “A One Hijra Stand-Up Comedy Show” in the Plaza Black Box and “The Chronicles of Kalki” and “Shiv” in the Plaza Theatre; M. Bevin O’Gara (who was at the helm for “Love Person”) directs the first two and Summer L. Williams the third. (You can see all three plays in one day on weekends, starting at 3 p.m.; the intervals don’t allow for much of a dinner break, but Company One is selling samosas in the lobby.)\n",

            "There are common threads. Shiv sails the cosmic ocean on a mattress; Kalki arrives in a downpour of rain and takes it with her when she leaves. Shiv and her father, Bapu, pretend they’re on the starship “Enterprise” and fish for constellations; Kalki’s friend has a bedroom ceiling that’s papered with glow-in-the-dark stars. Shiv and her friend Gerard drink bourbon from cups, Bapu and Brahman/i’s auntie pour it into Coca-Cola cans.\n",

            "The jewel in the trilogy’s crown is “The Chronicles of Kalki,” Kalki being the name of Vishnu’s yet-to-come 10th and final avatar. Played here by Ally Dawson, she’s a superhero who seems to have stepped out of a Marvel comic (Kapil says she grew up on comic books) to save Girl 1 (Stephanie Recio) and Girl 2 (Pearl Shin) from the horrors of “the high school hate machine.” But after being in town just a week, Kalki is missing, and a Cop (Brandon Green) is asking 1 and 2 to tell him and us about her, the play unfolding in flashbacks.\n",

At one point she tells Girl 2 to “give up your lips or suffer the blue kiss of oblivion.” As the sweet but alienated teens, Recio and Shin are masters of exasperated impatience with Green’s paternal but never patronizing detective; when he suggests that Kalki is their invention, they tell him, “Just because we made her up doesn’t mean she’s not real.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The other two plays are more problematic. “Brahman/i” reimagines Brahma as “a young intersex girl dude” who tries being a man first and then a woman. Aila Peck is accomplished as she takes on British colonialism, British accents, and more high-school horrors, and Kapil gives her a plethora of hilarious one-liners, but the humor can verge on smirky, and some of the barbs aim at easy targets or miss their mark. The best moments involve Brahman/i’s bourbon-swilling auntie.\n",
            "\n",

She gets a summer job as a housekeeper for a professor (Jeffrey Phillips) and starts up a relationship with his nephew (Casey Preston). Singh strikes an authentic Indian emigrant note as Bapu, but Sharma and Preston are oddly stiff and unconvincing together, and the play goes on too long.\n",

All three parts of “The Displaced Hindi Gods Trilogy” are worth seeing, but if you’re seeing only one, make it “Kalki.” The title character complains that being human means being alone, but you won’t feel that way when you see Recio and Shin go off hand in hand.\n",

            "\n",
            "De Carvalho is the supporting actor, so to speak, in my exclusive profile of Charlene de Carvalho, the sole heir to the Heineken fortune, in the current issue of Fortune. Until I sat down with the billionaire couple (she owns a quarter of Heineken, worth more than $11 billion) in Amsterdam in June, they had not shared her story, which is a sort of business fairy tale about a woman who learned to embrace her power. Charlene had never before talked to the media. And until 2002, when her father, Freddy—who built Heineken in America and expanded the brand to become the world’s most distributed beer on earth—died, she was a mother of five and dutiful investment banker’s wife in London. Walking out of the cemetery on the day she buried her father, Michel challenged Charlene to uproot her tidy life and become an active owner of Heineken.\n",
            "\n",
            "“We’ve gone mad!” de Carvalho, an insanely energetic 70-year-old, announced to Heineken executives as he whirled me through the brewer’s headquarters in Amsterdam. A few weeks before my visit, I had gotten a cold call from a London-based PR man, who told me that 2014 is Heineken’s 150th anniversary and the heiress was willing to talk for the first time—and that Michel, as outgoing as Charlene is shy, is fascinating too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Michel de Carvalho has certainly lived a life. Born to a British mother and a Brazilian diplomat father in England, he began acting as a child. Using the stage name Michel Ray, he was in several movies, but most memorably he played the shepherd boy Farraj who gets mortally wounded by a detonator in the epic Oscar winner, Lawrence of Arabia. He quit acting to go to Harvard, and then he infuriated his parents by putting off Harvard Business School to join the British ski team at the 1968 Olympic Games in Grenoble, France. He competed again with Britain’s luge team at the 1972 and 1976 Olympics—and went on to HBS and a banking career that included stints at Credit Suisse CS and Nikko Securities before Citigroup C .\n",
            "\n",
            "De Carvalho wooed Charlene, Freddy Heineken’s overprotected only child, on the ski slopes of St. Moritz, where both families had vacation homes. “The nicest thing Charlene’s father ever said about me was, ‘He’s not interested in Charlene for her money,’” he says. After he and Charlene married in 1983, she had five children in rapid succession—at 37, she had five kids under the age of seven. And until she was 47, when her dad died, Charlene had no money to her name except one share of Heineken stock.\n",
            "\n",
            "That day he died, Charlene went from holding one Heineken HINKF share, worth $33 in 2002, to 100 million shares—and control of the company. Michel helped his wife lean in and embrace her new power. He prodded her to get involved in the business, traveled the globe with her to see breweries, and helped her assess the management. Soon enough, the couple decided that the board needed to replace CEO Thony Ruys. Ruys recalls de Carvalho as a force to be reckoned with. “If you see a tsunami coming, you’re not going to manage the tsunami. You’re going to manage yourself,” Ruys told me. His replacement was Jean-Francois van Boxmeer, who has helped triple Heineken’s sales and is still CEO today.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many people thought that the de Carvalhos would sell Heineken. But a sale was their last resort. They told me a story about August Busch, the scion of the Anheuser-Busch dynasty, inviting them to meet soon after Freddy died. Though rivals, the de Carvalhos were friendly with Busch, who was in charge of the world’s largest brewer and worried about predatory rivals. In fact, de Carvalho says, they talked with Busch about helping each other’s companies expand distribution—putting Budweiser on Heineken trucks and vice versa. But the talks stalled. Had a Heineken-Busch venture come together, Michel says, “it might have changed the history of the Busch family.” In 2008, InBev ABI bought Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion.\n",
            "\n",
            "“It was quite shocking,” says Charlene, who views the sale as a bitter end to the Busch dynasty. In September, when another rival, SABMiller SAB , made an unsolicited takeover bid for Heineken, “the lady who throws the switch,” as her husband calls her, issued a quick and adamant “No.”\n",
            "\n",
            "De Carvalho likes to prod Heineken to reduce bureaucracy (“the cancer of corporations,” he says), move quickly, and invest to grow. “If you don’t grow, you start to die,” he says. Two years ago, the company won a takeover battle for Asia Pacific Breweries, the Singapore-listed company that owns the Tiger brand. De Carvalho calls the negotiation for APB “one of the most painful 10-year experiences.” Had the board agreed on a deal a few years earlier, he says, Heineken could have bought the company for about half the $4.6 billion price that it ultimately paid. “I’m always frustrated,” he says. He feels the heavy load of responsibility to guard the dynasty that his father-in-law passed on to his daughter. “One of the things that drives me is the thought that one guy is constantly looking down and wondering whether we’re going to fuck it up.”\n",
            "\n",
            "He seems to be keeping his end of the bargain. Last Friday night in Amsterdam, at the company’s Christmas dinner, de Carvalho spoke to about 50 of the company’s senior executives and board members about upholding this year’s theme: Women at Heineken. He thanked Laurence Debroux for joining Heineken as the company’s first female CFO. Then he singled out, as he told the group, “one woman who this year, more than ever, deserves thanks: my darling wife, whose out-of-character and seminal moments in 2014 included taking the lead in saying ‘No’ to SABMiller and agreeing to do the Fortune article, which removed the last vestige of anonymity.”\n",

            "Selling century bonds and other longer-term bonds – perhaps including selling 20-year Treasurys as well as the 40- and 50-year maturities – could help Treasury pull in as much as $400 billion from asset managers concerned more with matching their assets with their liabilities than with grabbing the last bit of yield, the committee said.\n",

            "\n",
            "Of course, this isn’t the first time the committee has discussed the merits of longer-term bonds. It was doing so in 2009 as government financing needs went off the charts. Even before the financial crisis sent federal spending through the roof, some wags were calling century bonds an appropriate response to increasing government financing needs. So far Treasury hasn’t bitten.\n",
            "\n",
            "But ohers have seen the ultralong light. Governments in France and the U.K. issued 50-year bonds in 2005, and the Danish central bank in 2006 published a report making the case that longer-term bonds afford substantial advantages to both issuers and purchasers. Mexico sold $1 billion of century bonds last fall.\n",

            "U.S. companies have gotten into the act as well, notably with Norfolk Southern’s NSC $250 million offering of 100-year debt in August. An ultralong Treasury bond “could appeal to the buyer of the longer duration corporates,” Valeri said.\n",
            "\n",

            "Longer bonds also could help to spread out the U.S. repayment schedule, which looks a tad crowded in the next couple years. Treasury faces more than $2 trillion of debt rollovers – bonds that will be repaid by selling new bonds — over the next two years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Longer bonds aren’t the only tweak the group recommends. The TBAC says the government could draw in some $1.6 trillion over coming years from banks by issuing callable bonds and floating rate notes, among other things, and tap some $300 billion from retail investors by issuing more liquid short-term products.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though the U.S. household sector now owns more Treasury bonds than China, the TBAC sees opportunity to sell even more Treasurys to retail buyers, to bring U.S. household ownership levels in line with those in Britain, Italy and Japan.

            "\n",
            "On a daily basis, a select group of individuals are making technology decisions on behalf of their entire organization. They’re implementing services to solve real business problems, sometimes under the guidance of their IT department, but most often on their own. For the first time, the power of technology decision-making is in the hands of those who will be using the solutions deployed. These are the managers, project leaders and knowledge workers responsible for getting work done – not just the IT administrators managing implementation or the executives writing the checks. This is truly a revolution in the enterprise, unlike any we’ve seen before.\n",
            "\n",
            "This shift poses a major challenge for today’s enterprises: how can we let technology run rampant through our organizations, technology that is fundamentally improving business outcomes, while still maintaining some semblance of a coherent IT strategy? It also creates a massive hurdle for legacy software vendors, who traditionally have only cared about one customer – the person buying and implementing their services – with little thought for the end user.\n",
            "\n",
            "In a recent Techcrunch post, Ben Horowitz argued that not much has changed – the “new boss” is actually the same as the “old boss,” and for IT solutions to succeed in the enterprise they still have to be sold to the CIO or C-suite. You can’t bypass the CIO forever simply in favor of adoption on the front lines. While Ben’s thesis is directionally accurate in that budget and oversight will always be controlled by those at the top, the point that is often overlooked is that adoption is now fundamentally different from buying. In prior decades, this distinction did not exist. Buying and adoption were, for all intents and purposes, synonymous. And adoption was something that happened grudgingly, after technology had already been forced on employees from the top-down.\n",
            "\n",
            "When end user adoption precedes buying, it happens with purpose and even excitement. Users now have a much greater say in what technology they use, so much so that it’s massively disruptive to the organization itself. There’s simply no way that IT administrators can get their proverbial arms around all the tools and services that individuals are bringing into the enterprise. Box.net is an example of the type of tool deployed in “Shadow IT,” implemented by end users to address a certain pain point, spreading virally throughout project teams and departments. It finally hits the radar of the IT Director or CIO, who at this point has two options: sanction the tool in its current use and evaluate it for broader deployment; or block it, risking a productivity drop and associated business consequences. Companies like T-Mobile, TaylorMade and Hawaiian Airlines have gone the former direction, but many others have taken the latter route, opting to stick with existing IT protocol and maintain tight control through on-premise systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "These are the options that every IT organization is facing today and will continue to face in the coming years. The adoption-buying split is broadening the disconnect between the roles and desires of end users and IT departments; such a disconnect cannot be sustained without negatively affecting business operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you enumerated the goals of the IT department today, they would look something like this: implement the fewest solutions to solve the greatest number of problems, maintain complete control over technology and information, answer to expectations around cost and risk, deploy proven solutions. These are fundamentally at odds with the correlated goals of users: use best-of-breed technology to solve problems, gain complete mobility and flexibility, answer to the productivity expectations of their manager(s), move quickly by using the fastest, most intuitive new tools. Although contradictory, both sets of goals make perfect sense. IT should be responsible for information security. Knowledge workers must be asked to move quickly and stay productive.\n",
            "\n",
            "So how do we reconcile these seemingly disparate but equally valid needs? Andrew McAfee recently suggested a methodology for managing enterprise software implementation: “…exercise tight control over technology choice, and as little as possible over technology use. Tight control over technology choice ensures that a big organization doesn’t wind up with hundreds of disjointed deployment efforts and fragmented technology environments.”\n",
            "\n",
            "This will leave IT with a more stable technology strategy, yet most enterprises already employ tight control over choice, and it’s not serving users very well. We must take into account the various users that need these tools to be productive. And as with many things in life, opting for compromise means that most everyone loses. In the interest of reducing the number of systems that need to be managed, companies may end up with the market’s least flexible CRM solution. Or perhaps they’ll buy a collaboration solution from the same vendor that provides them with networking gear. In both cases, IT wins in manageability in the short term, but users are likely to suffer usability and productivity losses – which means that ultimately, IT will have to become deeply involved in the “technology use” stage as well, providing user training, finding workarounds for lacking functionality, and taking complaints.\n",
            "\n",
            "Buying based on existing supplier relationships and system consistency — and avoiding a little chaos and user testing — is at the root cause of the problem with enterprise technology today: slow, awkward, and unloved by users. The challenge for the next ten years is to create and implement technology that supports the paradoxically different needs of both users and IT departments. We must re-build our enterprises in such a way that there’s a connection between our IT vision and what we’re demanding of employees. Enter the cloud.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Cloud changes everything. Really.\n",
            "\n",
            "By democratizing adoption, the cloud changes everything about enterprise IT. It’s now the sales manager that implements Salesforce.com CRM for her team. It’s the developer that brings Amazon S3 AMZN into his toolkit. It’s the support representative that selects Zendesk as the simplest solution for her customer service team. As a recent Forrester report noted, “Espcially in firms where IT is seen as plodding and cumbersome to work with, the new price points and preprovisioning of SaaS and cloud will foster renegade buying by the business.” Like it or not, users now control the mindshare of their company’s IT strategy, and enterprise vendors must begin to build tools that are meant to be used, not just meant to be sold. And this is why startups are inherently disruptive in new markets. They’re not beholden to the old business models that represent major profit centers. Starting at a much smaller baseline makes you immune to the risk of cannibalizing past product lines, simply because you have none. And this is why, in just a matter of three to five years, the enterprise technology landscape has changed dramatically. It’s also why, in the next three to five years, our corporate IT environments will look remarkably different than they do today.\n",
            "\n",
            "With enterpise software finally starting to focus on the individual, and not just the IT buyer, we’re seeing dramatic changes in business productivity, speed of execution, and overall sentiment towards technology. People are able to work much more quickly, access more information than ever before, and make decisions in real-time that are backed by data — all leading to a more open, connected and collaborative work environment. With the right solutions, even the IT professionals are happy — they’re finally able to get ahead of the game instead of always having to fight fires, solve problems, and answer to unhappy users. Take Manjit Sighn, CIO of Chaquita Brands, who explained to CIO.com’s Thomas Wailgum why he bypassed the entrenched ERP vendors in favor of Workday’s on-demand alternative and a more strategically-aligned IT organization: “I want my folks sitting arm in arm with business folks, talking about process transformation and trying to figure out how to bring products to market even quicker…not keeping the lights on running a system.”\n",
            "\n",
            "When an organization’s IT strategy is consistent with what will solve problems for its employees, we’ll see the emergence of a more productive, open, and social enterprise. To get here, IT professionals should be doing more “sitting arm in arm with business folks,” but this can’t happen unless the IT organization is enabled as a strategic group instead of just a technology support center mandated to avoid risk and maintain existing infrastructure. This conservative attitude is the reason that it’s safest to go with IBM IBM or stay with Microsoft MSFT SharePoint, and why innovation in enterprise technology lags behind consumer technology by many years.\n",
            "\n",
            "It may seem unrealistic to think about IT professionals as the heroes of an organization. They don’t belong to the department that makes the most money, or builds the products or services that their company sells. And yet, the IT department fundamentally powers all the activities at the lowest levels of how we operate our business in today’s competitive environment. Whether it’s end user adopted or company mandated, technology is powering everything we do and informing every decision we make: ERP, CRM, social business software, marketing automation, content management. But despite it’s influence, technology has almost never been maximized in the best possible ways, by all the possible parties. That is changing, and quickly. To do this, of course, software vendors have to put much more effort than ever before into building solutions that don’t fail their customers and delight rather than block users. We’re getting there. We’ve seen more progress made in moving towards a more user-centric IT strategy in the last year than in the previous ten years, and this revolution will continue to gain momentum – and attention – in 2011.\n",

At one lunch, I planned to have the prime rib French dip sandwich ($9.95), along with the rigatoni vodka ($9.95).  Even the fettuccine Alfredo ($14.95 at dinner), which got the closest thing to a hearty recommendation from the servers, had a thick, lifeless sauce.  [...] people visiting at dinner certainly won't go hungry.  All dinners come with a good minestrone, a generic green salad and dessert, which is usually rainbow sherbet.  There's also bread and a relish dish, although it gets so much spiciness from the juice of green chile peppers that everything from cauliflower to carrots to black olives tastes like the peppers.  There's a long bar with bottles displayed along the wall and televisions at both ends, and many walls of the restaurant have pictures of sports figures, particularly from the 49ers and Pittsburgh Steelers.  Owner Jack Marquard is from Pittsburgh, and many people show up to watch Steeler games at Zack's.  Tables are covered with red and white checkered cloths, although a closer examination reveals that they are plastic rather than cloth.  At lunch, the prime rib French dip comes on a wonderfully soft French roll, with a nice helping of the beef and a cup of jus.  [...] the mesquite chicken salad ($8.95) was mediocre.  A bag of precut lettuce and cooked chicken strips from any grocery store would have been an improvement.  When we ordered them on a very slow night, the half dozen medium-size prawns came with too little of the lemon butter sauce and rested on a bed of cappellini that managed to be overcooked and cold.  [...] the dish seemed woefully overpriced in comparison with the rest of the menu.  95, with a fillet of tender, crisply coated chicken in a chunky tomato sauce.  The garlic bread ($5.95) is good and the crab cakes ($10.95) OK, although they would have been better with an aioli instead of the tartar sauce that Zack's offers.  Besides the rainbow sherbet, customers also can order an ice cream truffle ($5), a frozen dessert of chocolate ice cream coated in chocolate.  There are no desserts other than ice cream or sherbet.

The &quot;thing&quot; he referred to is Project Homeless Connect, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's monthly gathering of volunteers to help his city's street people -- and Tuesday was its first anniversary.

Eleven young people died of asphyxiation in a crowd that was jammed together on an open plaza, waiting for the doors to open so that they could see a concert by the Who. Official inquiries have been conducted and the findings studied, and the policy of selling unreserved, or ''festival seating,'' tickets, a policy that may encourage enthusiastic fans to rush and shove for the most desirable seats, has been discontinued at Riverfront Coliseum and at many other rock venues.   But an incident as tragic as the Cincinnati concert deaths will not soon be forgotten. One suspects that it continues to weigh heavily on just about everyone who attends rock concerts, or whose children attend them. And some of these people were convin ced then and remain convinced that the true villain was rock itse lf.   On that December night at Riverfront Coliseum, a crowd of 18,000 was kept waiting for hours, in bitterly cold weather, on a funnelshaped outdoor plaza that was not designed to accommodate such a mass of people.

National Heritage Museum, Lexington. 617-354-1673, www.childsplay.org  SACRED SHAKERS The last time the Shakers played in town, they were making a live recording of their singular take on the sacred side of old country, blues, bluegrass, and old-time music. When they return for this date, you’ll have two good reasons to go: a nowadays-rare chance to see them live, and a chance to pick up a copy of that new record. Dec. 5, 8 p.m. Tickets: $15. Johnny D’s, Somerville. 888- 777-8932, www.ticketweb.com\n"
